§2- MARCUS CAELI US RUFUS. 11

was 1 matter whioh‚ even as early as February, appears to heve
begun to seriously vex the soul of 111 deeply·involved Caelius.

In April he went with Caesar to Spain, but we do not hear
anything of him during the eampsign. Before he went, 11 had,

at Gaesar's orders, written a most urgent letter to Oieero, begging
him not to leave Italy and join the Pompeian eamp, but to remain ψ
neutra] (Fam. viii. 16). He implores Oioero, if not 111 his own
at 11111 111 111 son's 11111, to be cautious, not to heed the upbraid·
ings of the optimates or the insufferable arroganoe of some of the
Caesarians (this, no doubt, Caelius himself felt most bitterly), hut
11 go into some small town, remote from thewar, and romain there
neutral 1111 111 should be over, or at least till 111 eonolusion of the
war in Spain. He tells him 1111 Caesar 111 beeome savage st
111 oontinued opposition he has met with, and expresses as his
opinion that ‘to aet against Caesar now that he is victorious,
while you were unwilling to injure him when his fortunas were
unoertain, and to join with those in their flight whom you would
not follow in their stand—this is the height 11 111113* Τ11
11111111 1111111 and dignified melaneholy of muoh of Cieero's
reply (Fam. ii. 16) 111 indicative of the different 1111111111 11
111 writer and his eorrespondent. Oieero will be oeutious, and do
nothing to lessen the good will whieh Caesar feels towards him 3 he
issorrythat Caelius should have so poor an opinion of his prudenoe,
but, by the despair he feels 1111 day, his heart has grown eallous,
and he is now past feeling sorrow at anything. ‘As to my son,
and I am glad you are interested in him, if any remnant of the
free state survive, I shall 11111 him 1 suffioient heritage in the
nemory of my name3 hut if not, his lot will be nothing different
1111111111 11111 rest 11 his fellow·oitizens.’†

But we are here not so mneh oonoerned with Gioero’s toueh·
ing reply as with the very low view Caelius takes of the eourse
one should adopt in politieal orises: as he had said before, ‘As
long 11 111 struggle is earried on in 1 eonstitutional manner
you should be on the more honourable sids3 when it eomes to

st ad 111 fugatos secedere, quos resistentes sequi nolueris, 11111111 stultitiae est.

† t t, Filio meo, quem tibi aarum esse gaudeo, si erit ulla respublica, satis amplum
tetimonium relinquam in memoria nominis mei: 1111111111 nulla eu't, accidet nihil ei
