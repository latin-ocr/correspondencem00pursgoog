xxii INTRODUOTION.

pointed out to him that the proviso was a slur on the Equites, who
would resent this offieial allusion to the methodo to whioh they too
often had reoourse. (110010 01 0000 tahas the hint; the ordinum
0000001110 10 0 paramount oonsideration, and 1110 proviso 101100 00

the transaotion be 01 00011 0 001010 that it ought 001 10 he upheld.'
The same gradual ohauge 01 11001 may be observed in his relations
with his predecessor. 'Pha Gilioians, on the departure 01 their
reoent governor, felt bound, aeoordiug to oustom, to send 0 depu-
101100 10 Rome to bear witness 10 the many virtues 011110 wild
boast who had just oeased to ravage the provinoe, and to thsnk
1110 Senate for its paternal govemment 01 110 dependenoies. These
deputatione to Rome 0001 money, and this money was raised by
imposta on the grateful towns, whioh, as the objeet of their grati·
tude had generally pluolred them pretty olean, often found 1110
burden very heavy. Such was the ease in the present 10010000.
The grateful towns seem to have eomplained to Oioero that they
really had not been 1011 money enough 10 sanda deputation to
Remoto express their admiration 01 their despoiler. At first

Oioero, full 01 the good resolutione whish eharaeterize new gover-

‘Many 01 the towns 0001 10 010 01 Apamea 00010 01 their leading oitizeus to

and moreover 0010001 the world, aud surely does not aare 101 00011 deputatione
in his honour. I reealled how these sometimes failed even to get a hearing at

bethought me how utterly useless 1110 whole thing waa’

Aooordingly Cioero ordered that any ono who really wanted 10
express his gratitudo 10 Appius should go 10 Rome at his own
expense, but that the towns should not be taxed for the purpose.
In a subsequent letter to Appius,† in whieh he shows muoh oon·
