lviii INTRODUOTION.

really harder than ansar's, for it did not deduot the interest
already paid from the prinoipal. Resisted by Servilius Isauricus,
the oonsul, and the rest of the magistrates, Caelius, ‘in the spirit
of J aok Cade,' as Mr. Fronde says, rushed into the wildest revo-
lutionary proposals-tenants of houses were to have them for a year
rent-free, and debts were to be abolished. Oi eoume when offering
sueh bribes (laelius got some support, suoh as it was, amongst the

’ lowest and most desperate oi the people and from a few of the

tribunes, and they drove Trebonius away from his duties. The
Consul and Senate, however, proteoted by a body oi ansarian
soldiers who were passing through the oity, oarried a motion
deposing Caelius from his magistraoy, or, aa the latin phrase
ran, ‘removing him from the republi03’ but this was vetoed by
tribunes. The oonsnl took down the table of lawa which Caelius had
posted up, hindered him from holding a maeting, and finally broke
his ourule ohair. Eren then Caelius did not iorget his sohoolboy
style of humour3 he set up another ourule ohair, tied together
with the kind of thongs with whioh boys were whipped, and the
peopled laughed, ior it was known that Servilius had at one time
reoeired an historio flogging from his father*

But it was all over with (laelius and his sowing oi society.
He pretended to leave the oity to lay his oasa before Caesam
but he had really summoned his old friend Milo (who was
suoh a firebrand that him alone oi all the exiles Caesar oonld
not venture to reoall) to oome and try to raise South Italy
against Caesar. But the towns oi South Italy were inhabited
by very eommonplaoe people3 abolition oi debts, manumission of
slaves, and suoh like oourses were altogether too heroio for them. So
Caelius and Milo were oompelled at last to have reeourse to shep-
herdslaves and gladiatore fora following; with the result that
Milo was killed in an attaok on the town oi Cosa, near Thurii, and

Caelius, at the age of thirty-seven, was put to deathinThuriiitseli
by some of Caesar’s Gallio and Spanish cavalry, whom he had
