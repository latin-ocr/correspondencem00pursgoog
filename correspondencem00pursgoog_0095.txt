53. HOME POLITIOS OF THE PEBIOD. xoi

oonoiliatory at the tima* hut it oould in a measure he represented

as suoh later 011. After an enumeration of the gresd services he
had rendered to his country, and a statement ol the terma of oom-
promise he had already offered, Caesar went on to oomplain that
the privilege of standing for¹ the consulship whioh had been
granted him by the people was being wrested from him by his -
enemies, and he oonoluded in these words: ‘Iam willing to lay
down my military oommand if Pompeius will do the same; hutif
Pompeius will not, neither will I, and I shall oome forthwith and
speedily to defend my oountry and myself.’† A violent outburst
ensued. The oonsul, Lentulus Orus, who knew as well as Caesar
that the only oourse to take with the inert Senators was to threaten
them, deelared that he would stand by them if they boldly and
oourageously did their duty to their oountry; but if they looked as
they had so often done to Caesar, he would take his own oounsel
and not ohey their authority3 lor he, too, had intluenoe and
friendehip to baolr him up-meening ansar.‡ To the same

Pompeius was quite prepared to ,defend the State if the Senate

be taken till the levy now on foot should be eompleted: M. Calidius,
that Pompeius should depart into Spain, and so out away all sauses
for war3 for (he urged) that it was only natural that Caesar should
tear to disband his own army, while Pompeius and his legions
remainod in Italy ; and to the same effeot spoke (laelius. Lentulus
msailed these moderate oounsellors with virulent abuse3 he point·

sartae) and that Caesar was ‘impudent’ enough to want to keep his army and

1 The word Carraria in Caes. Bell. (liv. i. 1. 4, is probably a gloss, but it perhaps
rightly represents the sense ol what Lentulus said. Il the Senatum did not aet with
rigour now, he and Pompeius end the rest of the meu of position and vigour would
