53. H ΟΜΕ POLITIOS OF THE PEBIOD. lxxxiii

Towards the beginning of June (we cannot fix the exact date)
Marcellus brought the matter oi the suecession to the provinces
once more before the Senate. This was a stirring and most im·
portant meeting.* The questions were put with the mostsystematio
precision. It was proposed and passed almost unanimously that

Caesar should resign the command oi his army. This was vetoed v

by Curio. It vves next proposed that Pompeius should resign the
command ol his army, and this was rejected by nearly as great a
majority. Ourio, however, insisted that these were nottho points
at all ; the right proposal was that ooth should resign simul·
tnneously3 and he forthwith formally moved it. This was a
bold stroke on Gurio's part, and it was entirely successful. To
the dismay oi the extremists, Ourio's proposal was passed by a
majority oi 370 to 22. The consul, Marcellus, turning on these
traitors to their party in bitterness and rage, and blurting out
‘Your victory is your slavery to (laesar' (νικᾶτε δεσπότην ἔχειν
Καίσαρα), dismissed the assembly. The vote, oi course, came to
nothing, as it was veteed by Furnius, the Pompeian tribune, but it
was of immense valae to (laesor. He could now, with considerable
appearance ot truth, plead, as he did aiterwards,† that he had
shown grem long-suffering and had even irem his side moved the
proposal that both Pompeius and he should dismiss their armies.
It also shewed the worth of Pompeius' offer to give up his army
iithe State wished. Things had, however, now corne to a dead·
loch, and it was not possible to do anything except wait and see
how events developed: besides the prinoipal electione ior 705 (49)
were coming on next month.

Already in May the Consors had been elected, L. Calpurnius
Piso Caesoninus,‘iather·in-law oi ansar, and Appius Claudius
Pulcher, of whom we shall have something to say presently. In
June there had been a party struggle for the place in the Collega

0 Uniortunataly no letter oi Caelius giving any notice of this meeting ie extant 3
no the account oi it has to be taken trum Appian (Bell. civ. ii. 30), who, however,
appears to put it three months'too late. Hirtius (Bell. Gall. viii. 62) places it before
the doeree that both Pompeius and Caesar should give the legions for the Parthian war,
ιι Lange (iii. 396, note 1) has aentely shown.

*t Caes. Bell. civ. i. 32. 4 (Gaesm to the Senate), patientiam proponit suam cum de
mersinbus dimittendis ultro postulavisset, in qno iacturam dignitatis atque honoris ipss
