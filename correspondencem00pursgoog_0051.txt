§2- MARCUS CAELIUS RUFUS. xlvii

Possibly, too, Spalding (on Quint. xi. 1. 51) isright in referring
to this speeoh the proof whioh Caelius essayed that he wasa
respectable man who spent his money judieiously (fraqi) ; beoause
he was usetnl (fructuosae) to many; fraqi and fructuosus being
etymologioally oonneoted.l He oould not have urged, adds
Quntilian, that he was fraqi in the sense oi sparing (abstinere);
that would have been too ridioulous a falsehood. If the whole ’
argumentis not a kind oi sohoolboy joke sueh aa Caelius would
have indulged in (as we think it is), we have in it another instanoe
of the old eoonomio sophiam-private viaes publio benefits.

We have almost in full the speech whioh Oioero delivered Pro
anlrb, and it is very interesting in its way. It deals, so far as the
definite oharges were oonaerned, with showing the improbability
that Caelius oould have named the murder oi the ambassadors
without the knowledge oi Clodia3 and with pointing out the pre·
poaterousness oi the oharge of poisoning. The arguments are set
downin very logioal form, and are not at all oonvinoing. Indeedif
ve may judge from the Cluentius and the Milo we should be inolined
to say that whenever Oioero puts his points with great apparent
oleamess in the form ot a logioal dilemma he is likely to be eloah-
inga weak argument. ‘If Caelius told you,' says Oioero, addressing
Olodia, ‘for what purpose he wanted the money whioh he spent
on etleoting the murder, you are an aooomplioe; ii he did not tell
you, you did not give the money at all '-whareas the oharge was
that (laelius got the money under false pretenees, in short, told
Clodia a lie, that he wanted it to pay the expansos of some gamas
wbioh he was intending to give. But the apeeoh is very good in
the part where Oiaaro is ‘raising the dust.’† He pours forth
all the gall and venom he possessas against Olodia. ‘I hate
tbe woman‚' he had said years before-‘ill pertner for a oonsul:
thaisashraw, alwaysfighting with her husband’ss Heremembered
bow this June had sounded the olarion in the attaok on himselny
and now he had an opportunity for revenge. And ot a truth

‘Quium i. a. 29.

Cluentii gloriatus est, nihil ipsa vidit.
