ΙΙ. ΟΝ THE LANGUAGE OF CAELI US. oix

Brutus ap. xi. lo. 3 (in ΜΗ). For further see Neue ii. 491 ed.
186lllith regard to the synoopated forms of the perfert stem when
that stem is formed by a euffix o, Caelius for the most part follows

what was the usual praellae. This is deseribed by Roby ἓξ ooo-1,
as follows :—All forms are synoopated exoept in lst sing, ard

sing, lst plu. of the perfeot; there are oooasional exeeptions like
audieram, dre, audere, dra, suoh forms being espeoially found in
the ease of peto, eo, and their oompounds: novero always, but
coquere, norim, noete ; in derina, peto, eo, and oompounds the
omission of o usually (’ the oompounds of eo almost always) talres
plaoe in the exeepted persone3 in other verbs with -i stems, -ἰίι
is sometimes found, oi hardly ever, -e‘r'mos never. This praatioe
Caelius for the most part follows. The only full forms he uses
are: 6.1, aestimarem speraveram 8. 1, audioi; 16. 1, reyno-
cerim. But caelius generally uses the synoopated forme, suah as
1. 4, diaeiyroront ; 15. 1, audeo] though he not unfrequently uses
the unsynoopated forms with the o omitted, e. 9. 4. 4, desieromua ;
8. lo, petii ,· 9. 3, arcessierit ; 10. 1, orcdiero; 12. 2, resciit ,· 16. 4,
audierat. In the seoond person sing. of passive tenses, just as
Cioero does, Caelius uses the form oie in the pres. india: 8. 2, ad·
mirarem ll. 4, suspicare. In the present subjunotive Oioero gene·
rally uses -νε, Roby ς 570. (laelius has 4. l, mirere, but 6. 1,
videarr'e ; 10. 2, deorse. As to the termination -ere for -erant in
the 3rd plural perf. ind. aot, ‘there is hardly a sound example of
-ere in any really good MS. of Oioero or Gaesar' (Reid ep. (lie.
Orat. 157 ed. Sandys), and Caelius never uses it.
