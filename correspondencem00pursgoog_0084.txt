worn out with worry and vexation that he was compelled, at the
beginning of April, to leave Rome lor Naples, where he fell
dangerously ill. So nothing definite could be settled.

During the montb ol April a letter written in February
arrived from Cicero to the Senate asking for a supplicati> in
honour ol his exploits on the Amanus* Ourio opposed tha grant.
He said he had the highest respect and admiration for Oiaoro, but
he was afraid that this supplicatio would be used by his opponente
to wrest some more comitial days from him. It was no doubt a
troublesome knut, and had to be untied by a compromise, it being

agreed that the supplicatio should be granted, but not till the Ἴ

ansuing year. ‘The attaok,' says Caelius (Fam. viii. 11. l,
Ep. cclxvii), ‘was short but sharp.' In the course ol it Cornelius

Balbus, ansar's accredited agent, said to Carrio that Caesar would 1
not be at all pleased with his aetion in this matter-a remark ¹
which gave considerable support to the opinion that Curio was
aoting in ansar's interest, and that Caesar was well-disposed ¹
to Oioero's elaims.

But Curio had now toturn his attention to the plausible pro·

posal of Pompeius that Caesar should resign his command on the
ldth of November, 705 (49). It had, as we have said, a great l
show ol lairness, but Curio saw that it must be hindered at all 1
risks. He did not lear opposition, he rather courted it. The ,
Senate, however, was opposed to deeided messuras. ‘Here is the J

oase,' says (laelius, with his usual clearness of vision ; ‘I tell you
this: il they coerce Ourio in everything, Caesar will defend his
tribunician authority: if, as seems the ease, they shrink from that,
Caesar will stay in command oi the army as long as he likes’
