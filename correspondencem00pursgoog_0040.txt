mvi INTRODUOTION.

Parthia, and 119 had at the same time to watoh and 11 neoessary
oheok any symptoms of revolt in Gilioia, and to keep the feudatory
and allied sovereigns in tranquillity and good humour. All this 119
suooeeded in doing with hardly any support from Rome, though
he tried to gain it even by appealing to the eupidity of the ruling
oligarohs. In a letter to the 8911919* he reminds them 91 the
terrible oonsequenoes of lesing provinces ‘on whieh depend the

revennae 91 Rome3' but even to their eupidity 119 appealedin vain.
Yet in these diffieult oiroumstanoes the 1119999199 whioh he took to
reaist the Parthian invasion were 99 11911 oonsidered that, had not
Cassius oheohed them at Antioeh, he might have won the glory of
repelling 9 Parthian 9119911, and avenging the 11191199 91 Crassus
and his legions.

Notwithstanding the purity of Gieero's rule, he found himself
at the expiry of his year of offioe possessed 91 2‚200,000 sesterees
(nearly 1811001). ,This sum he deposited in a bank at Ephesus,
and it was afterwards appropriated by Pompeius, and applied to
1119 expensas 91 the Civil War. In addition to this, he had a large
balanos of the sums voted to him by the Senate as supplies for the
carrying on of his government. Of this he gave a part 19 his
suooessor (laelius3 the 1991, amounting 19 about a million sesteroas,
he deposited in the publio treasmy, muoh to the indignation of his
staff, who thought this sum should have been divided among them·
salves. The 9919 91 the booty taken at Pindenissus had reelimd
some twelve millions of sesterces. About this 119 writes to Sallus-
tius‚† ‘Of my prins-money no one 1199 touohed 91 will toueh a
penny, sava the urban quaestors, thetis, the Roman people.'

It is characteristio of the whole spirit of this epooh of Roman
history that Oioero failed to seeure a triumph, ohiefly through the
oppositiones Cato, who, in a letterss of ponderous pedantry‚
assures Cioaro that in his opinion ‘far higher than the honour of a
triumph was the 1991 that the Senate held the provinoe 19 have
been saved rather by the gentle and upright 11119 91 the governor
than hythe 19199 91 arms 91 the meroy 91 the gods' Yet the
same dealer in high sentimenta prooured a supplication of twenty
days in honour of his semin-law Bibulus, who, ‘while there was a
single enemy in Syria, no more put his foot outside his oamp than
