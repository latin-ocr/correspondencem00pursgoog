PREFAGE.

-—000-·-

Tnn Prelaoe to the Seeond Volume of O1cnno’s Oonnnsronnuwcn
announoed that this and the other wolames would appear as the
joint work ol Mr. Purser and mysolf. It also expressed a hope
that tho third volume should suooeed the seoond after a muoh
shorter interval than that whioh elapsed between the publication
of the first two. We have suooeeded in realising this antini·
pation, and we hope to finish the whole work in two more
volumes in the oourse ot the next three or four years.

We shall be satisflod if we suooeed in presenting our readers
witha text based on the best foundations now available for
eritioism, and in adequately explaining that text. That part of
our duty will demand frequent oomment on the latinity ot this
most interesting body ot literature ; but our oomments must be
mainly in the interosts of interpretation, and we must refrain
from those minuta analyses ot style and idiom whioh make
some reoent editions of parts ot Oiaero's werke so interesting
and so instruetive‚ but whieh our design would put out ot our
power, even if we felt ourselves competent to undertalre suoh
delirate speoulations. Our historias] and arohaeologioal eomments
also must be striotly subsidiary to explanation.

We have taken paine about the assertainment of the order

of the letters, and have felt bound sometimes to depart from
voa. 111. b
