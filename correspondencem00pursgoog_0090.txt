lxxxvi INTRODUOTION.

sueh was virtually an attaolr on the eommonwealth‚ Caesar be
deolsred a publio enemy, and the legions at Capua be at onoe
sent against him under the sommand of Pompeius. Curio, in reply,
proved the whole story to be groundless, and vetoed the eonsul‘s
motion. A violent (lebate eumad, in the oonrse oi which Appius
Claudius, the eensor, formally expressed his sensoria] judgment ot
Curio. Then Curio, with line theatriesl offset, rent his clothes in
bitterness and indignation of spirit. And when Mareellns, thinking
indireotly to got a vote against Caesar, put the question ss to
whether, having regard to the oensor’s judgment of Ourio’s
eharsoter, the Senate would not express some opinion on his
persistent and vexatious use of the tribunioisn interoession‚ Ourio
at first protested against the Senste’s right in the matter, but
afterwards y'ielded with the oourageous and solemn asseveration:
‘I am oonsoious to ‚mysell of having done what is best and most
useful to my oountry: do you take my body and lile, and deal
with them as you plesse'* The Senators were not insensible to
this fine appeal, and, though Mareellus deelared thetis they
impeded him by any vote, he, as oonsul‚ would take his own
messures‚† they aequitted Ourio by a large majority. Marcellus
kept his word. Rising in his plaoe, and deelaring that he would
listen to‘no more words, but thot, as he already saw ten legions
orossing the Alps, he would send out one to meet them and
save his oountry, he hurried stenes, with the two designata
oonsuls, whom he had persuaded to follow him, to Pompeius, who
was outside the eity3 and thrnsting a swerd into his hand urged
him to use it to save his eountry, antrusting himen his own
authorityss and that of the two designate oonsuls, with the oom-
mund oi the two legions available, and authorizing him to roise
, more troops. Passious ran so high that the most glaringly unoon-
stitutional proesedings were now considered mere matters ol eourse.
Pompeius takes the illegal sommissiou, ‘ii nothing better ean be
done' (εἰ μή τι κρεῖσσον), as he said with eharaoteristio half·
