xxvi INTRODUC'TION.

that model of reotitnde. One oi these oopies (lato entrusted to his
freedman Philargyrus (ill-omened name), who embarked at Gen·
ohreae, suffered shipwreolr, and lost his oopy. 'Phe other (lato
kept in his own hands, and arrived with it safely at Corcyra.
While they were there eneamped under oanvas, one night the
sailors lit several large fires, the westher being very oold. Alasl
the tenta took lire, and the only remaining aopy was bumt—
ἠφανίσθη is the rather happy term whioh Plutaroh employs. He
inquito touohed by the oontemplation of the grief, whioh (lato
must have felt, at being deprived of the dooumentary evidenea ot
his matohless integrity. Oato was obliged to oontent himself with
the applause of hia oonsoienoe, and the evidenoe of Philargyrus
and the rest of his staff, who perhaps hed ae good reason as Cato
himself to regard with resignation the triolr of fortune which
seemed to Plutarch so spiteful. Others, inoluding Caesar and
Clodius, took a very different, and perhaps more reasonable, view
of this disappearanoe of the doouments.

Brutus perhaps stands highest of all, in oommon estimation,
among the heroes of the deelining Republio. Plutaroh asoribes
to him every virtue, and Dion and Velleius vie with Plutarch in
eulogy, Shahespeare, who takes his view from Plutareh, ealle him
‘the noble Brutus,' ‘the soul of Rome,' ‘the noblest Roman of
them all,’ and we read that-

‘ Brutus is noble, wise, valiant and honest,’
and is one oi

‘ The ohoiee and master spirits of the age)

Nor were hie contemporaries less lond in his praise than those who
fostered his posthumous renown. Not Plutaroh nor Lucan, Dion

nor Velleius, have transoended the tribute paid to him hy Atticus
and Oioero, when the former deelared that ‘if his friend should ¹
bring baok from his provinee nothing but the gratitudo of Brutus
he would still have good reason to be satisfied'3* and the latter
expressed his opinion, that his own son oould have no better edu·
oation than the oontemplation of the many excellenoes whieh

adorned the oharaoter oi Brutus, whom he desoribed as ‘now the

vesaniens).
