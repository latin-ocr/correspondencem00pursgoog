lxx IN TRODUOTION.

the eleotions for 704 (50) were held. Oato did not stand for the

oonsulship3 he said the people did not 11116 his manners, and no
man of 66666 would ohange his manners to plesse others (Plutarch
(1616 50). The candidates were (16161666 Mareellus, who was

666616 61 the oonsul of 703 (51), and appears to have been dorni·

66161 by his eouun’s influenee (Fam. iv. 9. 2); L. Aemilius
Paullus, 61 whom we have just spoken3 and M. Calidius, the
ansarian eandidate. The'latter was defeated, though there was
reason to suppose that he had bribed heavily: at least he was
aooused immediately after the eleotions on that oharge, but mades
most eloquent defense, and was amuitted.l The electione 61 Tri-
bunos, however, were favourable to Caesar: M„ Caelius Vinioianus,
a Pompeian, was defeated. The Pompeiane, in revenge‚ aooused
one of the (1666611666, Servaeus, 61 bribery: he was ooudemned,
and (1611661166 0611611116 atthis time professod himself a
supporter of the optimates, was eleoted in his plaoe. The praetor-s
who were eleoted were not men of any deoided party feeling
and took no 661116 part in politiae: 161 the only deoided
partisan who oompeted, M. Favonius, ‘Cato’s Sanoha' failed.
. Young Dolabella, who was betrothed to Oiooro’s daughter, Tullia,
was eleoted quindeoemvir, defeating L. Lentulus Orus (oonsul
next year): Lontulus was quite 6611616 61 victory, and when he
was defeated, ‘you should have seen his faoe,' says 06611116, 16
his sehoolboy way, ‘it was a most lovely sight.’† We hear ad
nauseam about the 6661661 161 the 661616 aedileship, 161 Caelius
was a eandidate: he finally defeated Luoilius Hirrus, a man who,
if we 666 believe what we are told, appears to have had 6 lisp, to
have been fond 61 quoting poetry‚ andto 1161611666 generally
· ridioulous, but who for all that seems to 11616 been a man of some
influenoe.‡

The question 61 the suooession 16 the Gallio prorinoes was not
settled during August, so Caelius had nottho 6611616611611 61 seeing
how Paullus would speak and 1616. There was 66 (1166666166 66
