furerat, vehementer hominem contemnebat, et suis et reipublicae copiis confidebat
Quid quaeris? Etsi mihi crebro ξυνὸς Ἐνυάλιος occurrebat, tamen lavabar cum virum

latae periculis disserentem.

Provida Pompeio dederat Campania febres

Optandrs sed multae urbes et publica vota

Viearunt Igitur Fortrma ipsius et urbis
Servatum victo caput abstulit.
