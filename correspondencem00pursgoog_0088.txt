lxxxiv INTRODUCTION.

ei Augure, vasates hythe orator Hortensius, who died in May.
The eandidates were L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, aud M. Antonius
(son oi J ulia, sister of L. Julius Caesar), who had been etosen by
Caesar as his quaestor? aud in whose oandidature Caesar took
sueh a keen interest that he earne baek from Northern Gaul to
Upper Italy in order to forward his eanvass. Caesar arrived teo
late to land his aid, but Antonius had, however, been eleeted
(Bell. Gall viii. 50). In J uly the eleetions lor Tribunos same
on. Amongst those ohosen the most important were this same
M. Antonius, who was a elese personal friend of Curio; Quintus
Cassius Longinus, who had been given as quaestor to Pompeius at
the latter’s own request, but was now a vigorous Caesarium and
Gaius Cassius Longinus.† In the same mouth the electioris for
eonsuls were unfavourable to Caesar: his eandidate, L. Culpieius
Galba, was defeated, and there were eleoted Gaius Claudius Mar-
uellus, brother oi the oonsul oi 703 (51), masin oi the eonsul of
704 (50), and L. Cornelius Lentulus Crus, who had in 703 (51)
been defeated by Dolabella, Cieero’s son-in·law, for the quindeeem·

deeply in debt, he was not altogether trusted: next year hs
appeared as a most violent opponent of Caesar. The praetore, as
usual, throughout the struggle, were men of no deeided party
biset .
Like a dead sultry afternoon, before a thunder·storm breaks at
nightfall, the whole of August and September dragged through.
There was hardly a morament, exoept when the oensor, Appius
Claudius Puleher, apompeus fool like Bibulus, but a patrioian aud
an Appius Claudius, beganto strat and fret hishour upon the stege.
He set to exereising his esnsorial rights with a sengeanee, and ex·
pelled fromthe Senate amongst others the historian Sallust-perhaps
justly, oertainly injudieionsly. ‘He thinks,’ says Caelius, ‘that

⁵ Quaastors were generally assigned by tot te the provincial governors, ep. Q. Fr. i.
l, ll, Ep. xxx: 2Verr. i. 34. The choortny of quaestore by Pompeius and Caesar
was notioed by Ciesro us unusual, Att. vi 6. 4, Ep. eelxwiii, Pompeius eo robore vir,
iis radicibus Q. Cassium sine sorte delegit, Caesar Antonium.
