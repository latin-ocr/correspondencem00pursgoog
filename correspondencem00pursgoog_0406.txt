294 ADDENDA 1¹0 THE ΟΟΜΜΕΝΤΑΕῩ.

(68 a. c), when a decree oi the Mate was passed dissolring the collegia, which tera
concessae dangerons (mlleyia sublata sunt quoe adomnia rsrnp. Metu esse,
Ascon, p. 7, Orelli). 'len years later Clodius procmed a law allowing the
collegia to be restored, end apparently giving nnlimited power oi establishing
new ones, with the result that a wast number oi muscis compitaiieia mose,
which, as Mommsen says (B. H . ir. 296), ‘were nothing else than a formal organisa-
tion-subdivided according to the streete, and with an almost military arrangemem-
oi the whole free or slave proletariat oi the capitel’: cp. Soet. 34, iisdem mmuliisr
inspectantibus seruorum dilectus ludebantur pro incusati Aurelio nornine clusura,
eum suatim homines conscriberentur, desumerentur, ad cim ad monus, od eaedem sd
direptionem incitarentur: cp. 553 pro Domo sua 54, cum in tribunali Asudio consm-
beiaspatarn non modo liberos sed etiam seruos ec omnibus uicis mncitatos: add Pia. ll
and 23, Post red. in sen. 33. Their full title appears to have been collcpic sodali&
(Dig. 47, 22, 1), and when the sodditatsr disappeared they mose. The name rrss
changed; the thing remmned.

It was against the organiring of clubs, established for the purpose oi brihery md
ifneccssary riot, that lawa de sodaliciis were directed. Haec doce, says Cicero (Plano
45), iaec profer, duc incumbe, Laurentem, decuriasse Plancium, conscripsisse, maanes
sumre, pronuntiasse, divisisse: cp. 38, uenditorem correptorem sequestrem erse. Thea
lawa bore not only against the candidates who won electione by the help oi cluis, hut
also against the organizare oi these clubs; and in this they diliered from the lawa con·
coming ordinary ambitus. 'l'he Lex Licinia de sodaliciis was passedin the second
consulship of Pompeius and Crassus, 699 (55 n. a), and it was the law under which
Plancius was accused by laterensia and defended by Cicero: cp. Schol. Boh. iii,
Orelli, M. Licinius Crassus—pertulit ut severissime quaerentur in eos candidatos qui sili
condliassent (sodales) eu potissimum de ceusu ut per illos pecuniam tribulibus dispertiunt
cc sibi mutuo eodem sseffrayationis emptae praesidia communicarent. One oi the chief
feauues of the law was the constitution of the jury (in ceses oi sodaliciis called iudices
editicii), which was chosen from four tribes named (editi) by the prosecutor oi which
tribes the defendant could reject only one, and the jury was chosen from the rendam
three. TheschemeoiiudiceseditieiiwassuggcstedbyServiusSulpicius‚in691(68n.c.):
cp. Cic. Mursa. 47. In ordinary cases oi ambitus the jury was chosen by lot from the
album iudicum and the defendant could challenge as many of the jurymcn as the praec
cutor. The penalty ior sodalicium appears to have been exile and a fine (radio, Plane
8; solus, patria, fortunae, ib. 79). There are only five trials recorded underthislsw
(Zumpt, drim‘inqurocess, tat-549, ctu), viz. in 700 (54) G. Messius (Art. ir. ld, 9,
Ep. cxliii), P. Vatinius (Fam. i. 9, eff, Ep. cliii), 0. Plancius; and in 703 (51) llilo
(decom, p. 54, Orelli), and M. Valerius Messalla (Fam. viii. 2, 1, Ep. cxcvi.; l, l,
Ep. θοή). ’
