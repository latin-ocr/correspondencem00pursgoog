During Cicero's ahsenoe from Rome the main subject which
engressed the attention of all politieians was the succession to
the Gallio provinces, or more definitely, and 116111 another point ,
61 view, whether Caesar should be allowed to 66111666 for the
consulship while absent, and without resigning the command of
his army. Just asin 611 epidemio every ordinary disease ulti-
mately, more or less, merges in the prevailing one, 66 every
political question at Rome during the eighteen months while Cicero
16661161,Μ61,703(51),16Ν61.,704150), came to he in someway
cr other connected with the great question, ‘Was account tc be
taken of Caesar in his absencel' Accordingly almost 6111 whole
disomsion in the present section will hare reference to this suhjeot;
bnt 16 understand it, we must go back a little.

By the Vatinien Law, passed in 696 (59), Caesar obtained the
government 61 Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum for five years, that
government to expire on March 161, 700 (54). In 699 (55) the
'lhehonian Law 36161116 government of Syria to Crassus, and
61 the two Spains to Pompeius, for five years; and the two

musula, Pompeius and Crassus, passed a law that Caesar's govern-

ment of the two (161116 should he extended for five years.† A diffi-
culty has been raised as to the date from which the tenure of office

decreed to Caesar by the Lex Pompeia-Licinia began to run ;
hut there can be little doubt that the most rational view to take

isthat it began from the day on which the tenure of office granted
by the Lex Vatinia would 66666, that is, from March lst, 700 (54).
Accordingly Caesar’s second grant of five years would expire on
March lst, 705 149).

Caesar, we know, had held the consulship in 696 (59). Now

elected Consul wasloi (69), not 706 (48).
