he dates hia landing in Asis from the scuffle ou the Appian Way,
in which Clodius lost hia 111 . ‘Now,' he writes to Atticus,† ‘now
are put to the 1001 110 theorias 01 conduct which I have so long
parsded' This reflection (which does not seem to have occurred
10 him again) was forced on him hythe enthusiastic receptior
given him st Ephesus, which was the more gratiiying because
Ephesus formed no part 01 110 province. It was not their governor
whom they weloomed, but the man 01 far-iamed learning, intcgrity,
and eloquencc, the prosecutor 01 Verres, and the Esther 01 his
Gountry. But not even this tribute could make Cicero remember,
ior more than 0 few minutos at a time, that there was a world
outaide Rome. In the same letter he writes: ‘Pray give me a

habitually practised by Roman governcrs-he was withheld, not
only by the precepta of Atticus, but by his own gentle and cle·

conduct and the behaviour 01 110 staff. But there was something
more important still than the well-being 01 110 provinces. This
was the ordinum concordio, which is still his cabula and teliaman.
'l'heae two aima often did not coincide-indeed, they were often in
direct conflict. And when they did conflict, this best 01 proconsuls
showed himself only too ready to sacrifice the province. When
