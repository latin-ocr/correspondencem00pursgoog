cii IN TROD U ΟΤΙ ON.

antiquarium puto ut Caelium ex ea parte laudet qua antiquus est?
We must confess that in a large measure these strictures seem
just.

When we consider the small packet of letters by Caelius which
we possess, we must own that he does use a considerable number of
rare words, e. g. 1. 4, susurratores ; l. 5, subrostrani ; 5. 3, incile ,-
6. 3, eonqlaeiare ; 6. 4, cohorticula, aquarius (‘a water-commissioner'),
veternus ; 8. 1, invocatus (‘unasked': only occurs once in CicerO,
viz. N. D. i. 108); 9. 4, columnarii,· 9. 5, contristare ; 10. 2, velificari
(‘ to give a list to’); 15. 1, nugax.

All the above the author of the Dialoque on Orators would

doubtless characterize as sordes verborum, to which we may
add the following :—

1. 4, vapulare, ‘ to be thrashed ³ (of an army).

1. 5, quod illorum capiti sit .· cp. Ter. Phorm. 111. 2. 6. which is
a quite un-Oiceronian use of the locativus finalis .· the only ex-
ample in Cic. and Caes. is tendere manus alicui.

3. 2, seeundum eius fidena, ‘ as far as his honesty is concerned.'

4. 3, mea comitia opinionem inm-edibilem nacta sunt = ‘ an extrae

ordinary expression of opinion has been delivered as regards my
election.

6.. 3, serven tissime concerpitur, wherein Caelius no more thought
nf the metaphor in ferventissime than the low-class Londoner does
iu 111² s favourite ‘ blooming ' (Caelius appears to affeet the word
*si-swuster, cp. 8. 2).

Η. 9, Pompeio eum Caesare esse negotium, ‘something (i. e. a
quan-el) is going on between Caesar and Pompeius.’

&irem bonum ludit (9. 1), ‘heis playing the good citizen ἐ though
fit-hrum (Antibarbarus, ii. 36) says it means that his action is a
perf 12th parody of the good citizen (the ordinary word is ayere .·
up. ΓΡ. 1, mirificum civem aqis).

11. 1, nunquam = non .· cp. Donatus on Ter. Andr. ii. 4. 7,
πωμμπηῃι plus habet negationis quam non, and Schmalz, ii., p·
lm.

ibid. iudicium in bona spe est = ‘ there are good hopes about the
res-ult- nf the trial.’

15. 2, discupio, ‘to be bursting' to do a thing (cp. Plaut. 'Prin-
