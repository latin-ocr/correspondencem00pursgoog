xoii INTRODUOTION.

‘the slew and ineffioient person,'* was so brow-beaten that ΒΘ

gave up his motion. So the majority of the Senate, intimidated
and ooeroed by the violent language of the oonsuls, the terror of
Pompeius' army and the threats of his friends, woted ior what
Metellus Scipio had reeommended—that (laesor should dismiss his
army before a fixed day, and that, if he refused, he should ΒΘ

the rest of the Senata, exoept Curio ond Caelius, followed Scipio.
When the vote was deolared‚ Antonius and Cassius, the tribunos,
