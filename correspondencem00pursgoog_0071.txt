might he, and was intended tobe, put to, and raised a elamour that
it was directed against Caesar. Thon Pompeius added an exeep-
tion, that oi oourse it did not apply to those whom the people had “
exempted from the obligatior of personal attendanoe-an exception
invalid formally‚ as inserted by the mere authority oi Pompeius
without having been passed in due oourss oi law, and futile ·
materially‚ for, as Dio (lessius (xl. 56) very wisely remarks,
those against whom it was direoted‚ namely, the most powerful‚
would easily get this exemption from the people. The law was
altogether ol little importanoe; but it shewed the taetios ol
Pompeius and his party, and we must add the carelessness of the
Caesariana. The latter were not yet thoroughly alive to the
manoeuvres oi their opponente.

Thus the net had been woven, and all was ready prepared in
the middle of May, 703 (51), when Oioero leit Rome. Caesar
must be dislodged from his provincial governorship il possible on
Marah let, 705 (49), and not allowed to stand ior the oonsulship

was to be fought: we have now to see how that oontest prooeeded.

The Consule for the year 703 (51) were M. Claudius Marcellus
and Servius Sulpioius Ruhis. The former was the ideal oi the
better elasa of aristoorats, rather heavy, perhaps, hut a man oi the
highest oharaeter, and perfeetly true to his principles3 therefore a
resolute enemy oi Caesar. Sulpioius Rufus was a eautious lawyer,
who, with great impartiality, and aoeordingly little influenee,
eontented himself with warning the aristoorats not to oany things
with too high a hand (see espeoially Fam. iv. 3. 1). He is
ohiefly known to posterity for the letter of oonsolation he wrote to
Oioero on the death ol Tullia, whioh has supplied Byron witha
subjeot for one ot his lineat passages (Fam. iv. 3: op. Byron,

Ohilde Harold‚ iv. 44 ε

‘Wundering in youth Ι traoed the path of him
The Roman friend of Rome’s least martel mind‘)

Neither of the oonsuls were men ol genius or vigam. Caelius hits
