xxviii IN TRODUOYION.

Now let us see how Brutus appears in the letters oi this
period.
This paragon of virtue who exelaims in the play,

‘Let the gods so speed me, as I love
The name of honour more than 1 sear death,'

had, as we have seen, aooompanied his unole Cato to Cyprus, and
had himself brought baoh the money realined to Rome. But it
appears from the letters oi this time that the young inoorrnptible
had not been idle, or intent solely on publio business, while he
sojourned at Cyprus. He had been loohing ont for a profitable
investment, and had suooeeded in seeuring eustomers. The people
of Salamis in Cyprus, impoverished by imposte and exaotions,

suooessiul oampaign on Mount manus, Oieero one day reoeived a
visit irem a oertain Scaptius, who same with a strong letter oi
reeommendation from Brutus. The Salaminians, said Seaptius,
owed him a large sum of money, and he was desirous that Oioero
should appoint him Preieot of Cyprus. He expeoted that by
means ol the powers whioh that post would eonfer on him he
