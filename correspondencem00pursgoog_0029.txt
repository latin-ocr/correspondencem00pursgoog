001011 will be remembered, ohiefly through the influenoe 01
Clodius, who wanted to get him out oi the way, was entrusted
with the summissior 01 settling the affairs 01 Ptolemy the Cyprian.
Egypt and the 1011 1010 01 Cyprus, the last 01 the oonquests 01 the
lagidae, hed been bequeathed 10 Rome by the testamentus
Alexander ΙΙ. But the Senate was not desirous 01 annexing
Egypt, the position and finenoial organisation 01 whioh would
bare invested a Roman 00001001 with powers whioh seemed
tormidable 10 the suspioious and feeble govemment 01 the oli·
gurohy.* The two illegitimate sons 01 King Lathyrus‚ Ptolemy
the Flutaplayer‚ and Ptolemy the Cyprien, were allowed 10 take
possession respectively 01 Egypt and Cyprus. The Flute-player
was permittsd to buy off annexation 101 the sum 01 6000 talents
(1‚460,000l.). His brother was too penurious 10 part with suoh 0
very large ransom, 01 perhaps he doubted whether the Senate
would keep faith with him 01101 he hed paid the money. Atell

year 58 (696), and Μ. 0010 was deputed 10 settle the affairs 01
Ptolemy. This west-minded usurper, on hearing that the Roman
people had resolved to take his affairs in hand, put an end to
hiuseli-perhaps, indeed, sensibly enough. The sale 01 his goods‚
whioh 0010 entrusted 10 his nephew Brutus, realized nearly 7000

tofill the maw 01 the Senate if the King oould hove persuaded
himself 10 spend it in bribes. Brutus himself brought the money
toRome; but poor Cato, aeoording to Plutaroh,† was the 01011111
01 Fortune's most 011101 spite. He had made, as bound by lew,
two oopies 01 the 0000111110 01 the whole 110100011011, which would
10100 proved (thinks Plutarch) that not a draohme or sesteroe 01
