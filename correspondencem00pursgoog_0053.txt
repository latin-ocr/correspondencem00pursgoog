danger,’ said Cicero, in a letter to his brother, ‘that the savage
Pola Servius will lead the accusation. For our friend Caeliusis
being violently assailed by the Clodian family! * A good fighting
pair they were3 but we lose sight of them now, end do not know
either how the contest went on or how it ended. Clodia, too,

disappears from the history of Caelius. It would seem that he -

ultimately escaped both from her love aud her hatred after a long
struggle3 but we question if he ever forgot her.

We hear no more of Caelius till he was elected tribune for 702
(52). During the beginning ol that eventful year Caelius, as a
purtisan of Milo, shewed at his best as a stauuch, courageous, and
impetuous friend.† With all his faults Caelius seems to have
loved his friends as he hated his enemies. ‘Yon are not taking

any active part in politius: said Cicero to him some two years
luter. ‘I fancy because you are drawn different ways, aa yon are
betha good citizen and a good friend.’‡ About J anuary 25, in
the agitatione which immediately succeeded the burning ol the
curia, Caelius, as tribune, gave Milo an opportunity of addressing

the people: both urged, as Cicero did afterwards, that it was
Clodius, and not Milo, who lay in weit ior his enemy. But
while they were holding the meetiug the opposite fact-ion came
up in overwhelming force, and Caelius and Milo had to make their
escape in the disguise ol slaves. Later, when the Clodian party
demanded that the slaves of Milo should be given up to tortura, in
order that evidence might be extraoted from them, Caelius made
a similar demand for the slaves of Clodius. On the Kalends
ol March, when Pompeius' bille dc oi and de cortilo were brought
before tha people—bills on which the Sancte had passed a resolu-
tion that the death of Clodius was an attauh on the authority of the
State-Caelius opposed them on the ground that they virtually
amounted to a pricilcpiam against Milo, and that the trials were
being hurried on with undue precipitancy. ‘And when Caelius
