52. MARCUS CAELI US RUFUS. liii

is oerteinly most savage when he is refused a loon of money.
(laelius blazed up, and poured out his indignatiou to Oioero ina
really entertaining letter (Fam. viii. 12. Ep. mlxxix), ‘After Ι
found that he did not think me worth repaying for the servioes Ι
had done him, Ι preferred to bind myself to a man totally dis·
oonneoted with me, and (beoause I am your friend) nol af all Α
kindly disposed to me, than to have to tolerate the look of that ape 1’
Appius grew indignant, and onoe more set the Claudiae bull·dog,
Pola Servius, ou Caelius, just ee the latter was holding his gemes
as Ounrle Aedile. They aooused him of unnaturel orimes, whioh
Caelius promptly answered by eoousing the starohedup (lensor
Appius himself on the seme oharge; and aleo by publioly de·
mauding from him the shrine belonging to the people whioh he

had appropriated—he, the Censor, who should have severely
punished suoh an appropriation in the ease of another. Caelius
had deoidedly the best of it. This is all amusing enough, and
tharsis a good deal of elementary human nature displayed3 but
itis espeoially noteworthy as showing the violenoe in auger and at
the samo time promptitudo in aetion, whioh were salient features

iu Caelius' oharaoter.

Itis not very easy to fix the exest time when (laelius began to
think seriously about joining the Caesarians3 butin September, as
we have seen, he was attaolred by Appius Claudius, the Censor,
ond sought the aid of the other Censor, Piso Caesoninus, a
supporter of (laesor. This tended to draw him away from the
Pompeiane. A violent hostility whioh sprang up between him
ond Domitius Ahenobarbus, a strenuous anti-caesarien, must heve
strengtbened this tendenoy. When (laelius wrote viii. 14, Ep.
oelm (late in September), we may say his mind was made

up.

‘ The lore-matoh is going to issue inopen war. I don’t know whatto do,
lt is Caesar’s oause, not his followara, that I datest. You ought netto
forget, however, that, in a quarrel, es long as matters are oonduoted oon·
stitutionully without appeal to arms, one should follow the mora honour-
obla side (maestiorem partem); when it eomes to a question of war,
the atroayerj (firmiorem); the ‘safer’ then is the ‘better' In the
approaahing oontest I see Pompeius will bava the &nats end the jndges:
ull will llook to Caesar, who live either with leur herging orer them or with
no hope of bettering themselves ; as to the army there is no aomparimn’
