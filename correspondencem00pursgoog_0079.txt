his debts, which amounted tc sixty million sesterces (3570,000).*
‘The price was high,' says Mommsen, ‘but the commodity was
worth the money.' At the beginning of hie tribuuate, (lario, still
cstensibly a constitutionalist, proceeded to piolr a quarrel with the
optimates in a somewhat original manner: and it was ou this wise.

The Senate, Curio wished it to appear, had not, in their concern
for the Gellia provinces, been looking sufficiently after the inte-
rests of the State: there were a number cf grievances which called
for legislatiou. Accordingly, he began tc pose as the independent
politiciau, whose sole concern was the good of his follow-citizens,
and who wished that the others would give up their fighting and
mind their business. He at all events was going tc mind Ιιίο
business, and accordingly proceeded to legislatc, indeed to legis·
late without quarter.† The legislation was, of course, all sham,‡
and only intended to irritata the aristocrats. He proposed the old
stock measure that the allotment of the Campanian land made in
ansar's consrdship be reconsidered3 which annoyed Pompeius, as
the allotment had been largely made to the scldiers of his Asiatic
army. Nc less was Pompeius annoyed ct Ourio's proposal to
restore Gaius Memmiiu,§ who had two years before attempted to

authentiam but itis only fair to say that Velleius (ii. 48) leaves the question open ‘ld
gratis an acceptis centies (qu. sexcenties) sestertio ut accepimus in medio relinquemus!
It would appear from Fam. viii. 4. 2, Ep. ccvi, that Curio had offered himself oo
Caesar before, but that Caeam did not think fit to accept his services. (laelius, (lurio's
close friend, wrfting to Cicero ou the first of August, tells how Guriois mnrasdng lor
the tribuuate left vacant by Servaeus, who had been found guilty of bribery, aud goes on
to say, ‘ Curio has indeed caused great alarmamcng many who did notknowhim or how
easily he could be swaycd, but, as I hope and wish, and as he states himself, he will
prefer the constitutionalists audthe Senate. In his present state he ie entirely bub-
bling orer with this plan (lctus, ut nane eet, boc scaturit). His intentione in this
directior owe their spring aad metire to the fact that Caesar, who is wout to attach to
himself at any price the lowest people aa friends, has most marledly shown supreme
contemptior Curio!
