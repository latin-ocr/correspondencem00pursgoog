xvi INTRODUOTION.

who had written the De Republica and the De Εερίὂιιε, and who
was to write the De Officiis, seems to feel no interest in the op·
portunity afforded him of putting some of his ethioal and politionl
theorias to a praetioal test; and that the 'sager student of History
and Geography finds nothing attraotive in the unexplored moun·
tain treats or in the historio plains of Oilioia.

Yet this region of Asia Minor between Mount Taurus and the
Mediterranean, stretohing from Pampylia on the west to Syria on
the east, had muoh in it to quiolren the interest and fire the
imagination of a man so cultivated es (liosro. The wild fastnesses
’ of Gilioia Traohea were the haunts of robber ohieftains aa breve,
if not as romantio, as Rob Roy, Roderiok Dhu, and Dirk
Hatteraiok. The very names of the towns frown at us like
avvful preoipioes and yawning ohasms-Ooraoesium, Charadrus,
Holmi‚ Melania, Rhegma. The words themselves are forbidding,

they again sooured the sea with their vessels and defied their
oonquerors. In Oilioia Campestris, on the other hand, the eye
roams over smiling plains, shining rivers, and Mauris towns.
One would have supposed that the learned Oioero would have
found an interest in Anchiale andita associatione with its founder,
Sardanapalus3 in Issus, the soene of the great Alexander's
triumph3 in Tarsus, the birthplaoe of Antipater; in the river
Marsyas, the soene of an insident in whioh Cioero himself might
have aspired to play the inferior part.

But no; his oorrespondenoe, eopious and unreserved as it is,
tells us about the history, the geography, the manners and oustoms
of his provinus-nothing. Relentless rontine demands that for a
year he shall bury himself in the grave of provinoial life. He
puts the hateful subjeat as far as possible away from him, and ‘his
only soneern is, by what means oan he make it oertain that a year
shall bs the limit of his misery. He oonoeives himself to be going
out of the light into the darkness. ‘Tell me,’ he writes to Caelius
on the eve of his departure ‘neither the past nor the present, but
the future! ¹⁸ He little thought that it was in the provinoes that
