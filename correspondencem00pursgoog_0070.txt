Pompeius passed another law in 702 (52), that candidates for

any magistraoy should tender their names in person, apractioe
which had been required previously, but had fallen into disuse

This law must hare been posted up for a tricensimum, and yet it
appears to have been passed without any protest from (laesar’s
party, which at this time was led by the tribune Gaius Vibius
Pansa. The law oi the Ten Tribunos had sc explicitly granted
Caesar the privilege, and personal attendance was aucha mere piace
of formality,§ that probably they thought that the new law would,
as a matter of course, not be in any way used to ansar's dis·

†ansar appears to hare heated the Transpadanos as full citizens, while it would
seem that in strict legality they had only Latin rights: see an excellent note in
Mommsen, R. Η. iv. 312, where he urges that only on the suppositicn that Caesar was
traating the Transpadana towns as possessed oi rull citizenship could the repert herc
arisen that they were ordered by Caeam to elect quattuorviri (see netes to Bp. clxxxv.
2). ‘This hypothesis too explains why Hirtius designatas the Transpadana towns as
‘colonias oi Roman burgesses' (B. θ. viii. 24) ς and why Caesar treated the colony ot
(toruum, founded by him, as a burgas-colony (Suet. cae. 28, Strabo, v. 1. p. 213,
Plutarch Gaea 29) ; while the moderate party ofthe aristocrscy conceded tc it only the
same rights as to the other Transpadana colonies, viz. Latin rights, and tha ultras eren
declared the ciria rights ocnienad on the settlers as altogether null, and consequently
did not concede to the Comenses the privileges attached to the holding of a Latin
municipal magistracy: see Cic. Art. r. 11. 2, Ep. cc. Appian, B. 0. ii. 26.’

§Marius and Lucullus had been elected to tha consulship in their absence, and
Cicero, too, in a speech delivered during his consulship, says (De lege Agr. ii 24) that
candidates ior magistraeies need nct appear in person. Yat three years later 694 (60)
Caesar gare up a triumph in order to satisiy the law by which pcrsonal attendance was
compulsory. The enactment appcm tc have been a portion of a law passed by cicero
in his consulship against ammas (Lange. i. 718, 263).
