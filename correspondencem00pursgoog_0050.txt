xlvi INTRODUOTION.

alleged that (laelius had murdered or oaused ιο ιο murdered some
Alexandrian ambaseadors, and had tried to poison Olodia. The
proseeution was oerteinly instigated by clodia and her brother, it
vas led by Atratinus, and beoked by Herennius and Balbus.
Caelius defended himself, and the defenoe vas supported by his
two masters, Crassus and Gieero. Some notiees of the speeoh
vhioh (laelius delivered on this ooaasion are preserved, and they
are oharaoteristio. He was nominally defending himself, but he
really stood out on the offensive. He apologiaed to the judges
for his violenos of manner and expression. ‘I pray you, j udges,

and all eonneoted with this trial, to pardon me if my loolr be

ever too offensive, my voioe raised ιοο high, or, what is a trifle,
if my gestures seem too extravagant' ¹* He exeroised his
espeoial gift of giving telling niolmames oertain to eleave to those
to whom they vvere applied. He oalled Olodia, as vve have seen,
a‘tvopenny-halfpenny Clytaemnestra' and one Plotius Gallus,
vvho was supposed to have written his speeoh for young Atratinus,
he desoribed as a ‘attilly-fed rhetorioian’ (rhetorem hordeariam).†

’ ⁸ Quintilian, xi. 1. t1. N e oui vestrum atque etiam omnium, qui ad rem agendam

adsunt meus aut vultus molestior aut rox immoderatior aliqua aut denique, quod mini·
mum (al. nimium) est, iactantior gestus fuisw videatur.

† We do not profess ιο ιο very eertain as to vhat this means. Suetonius (aba 2)
explains it hy deseribing Gallusas inflatam aa larem aa sordidum. casaubon supposes
arelatense to the inferiority of barlay as nourishmeut ιο vheat, in that it puffad out
those vvho οιο it without strengthening them; and refers to the faot that it vas one of
the punishments in the Roman army ιο put a man on a diet of barlay instead of vheat.
Gallus vould then be a starveling speech-writer, and the above translation perhaps
will be sufficiently abusive. Friedlfander (Sittsayesehtchts Roma iia att) referring
ιο this passage would appear ιο give ιο the niolrname a meaning almost opposed ιο that
given by Suetonius. He says the epithet hordeariae vas applied ιο gladiatam ιοοοοοο
they were generally fed on barlay (ep. Plin. H. N. xviii. 72), and so a rhetor hordeariae
would be ‘a gladiator, a bully, of a rhetorician! But vera gladiatore, vho required an
exoeedingly strong physique, ymerally fed on barleyt Friedlander gives no satiatae-
toryproof that they were, Galen (vi. p. 529, ed. Kuhn) only says that a little barlay·
meal was mixed up with their bean-porridge. Was it not most probably a punish·
ruent in the gladiatorial sohools also aa vell as in the army to put refractory memben
on barlay instead of giving them their usual noufishing mixture (saetam And if tho
wardia a niokname at all, would not a niolrname be most naturally applied to those
who vere subject ιο this diegraoe? We think it possible that it vas an old name
(henes the imperfect mostratur in Pliny) for gladiatore, whom early times may have
been fed oubarley; then any sort of oreaturea who oould stand up and be knocked
dovn vould suffiae, no great strength or skill being required of them till their eombata
became one of tha stapla amusemeuts of the Roman paople.
