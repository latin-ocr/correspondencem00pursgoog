300 ADDENDA TO THE OOMMENTARY.

Ep. cxxxv. ; ior there Appius, wanting to put off the Comitia, argues theton the one
hand the lex Pupia does not absolutely preclude the holdingoi the Senate on the
comitial days in the latter part ol February (ior the Pupian Law allowed oi certain
exceptione), and on the other thet the Lex Gabinia deehrea that all the sittingsin
February (ii necessary) should be given to hearing ambassies. But the perurge cer·
teinly dosa seem to prore that the Pupian law enacted that or a cernel rnle the bade
should not be held 011 eomitinl days; so thatthedecrce mered by Cicero in 691 (63 ιο)
which lorbade the Comitia to be held on a certain comitial day, does not neecsaanly
establish the conclusion thet it was directed ageinat the lex Pupia. It was only esa
matter of convenience and urgeney that it wae proposed that the Comitia in this cuc
be put oli to another eomitiel day.

Aa we hare been discussing a matter connected with the Senate, this maybethr
place to redeam a promise made (Fam. viii. 9, 2, Ep. ccxi.) with regard to a discum
on whether a minimum oi senators was necessary to enable e decree to be paased.

The practice oi counting out the house (see note on Att. v, 4, 8, Ep. clxxxviii),
taken in connexion with Dio (lass. mix. 30, μὴ συλλεγομένου δὲ τοῦ καθήκοντος lr
raia νομίμων ἀριθμοῦ πρὸς τὸ ψηφισθῆνοί τι περὶ τῶν ἀρχαιρεσιῶν οὐδὲ χρηματισθῆκίτι
ἀρχὴν περὶ αὐτῶν ἠδυνήθη, seems to point clearly to the conclusion that e tired number
of senators was required to be present to enable e decree to he carried. And it ie uo
objection to thie that in the case of some important mettere the minimum requiredia
fixed at a relatirely high number, e. y. no secret ritca were allowed according to the
80 de Bacchanalibus (l. 18, Wordaworth, p. 173) unless at least 100 senatore were
present iu the Senate which canedonod them; in Livy, xlii. 28, 9, we find at least
150 required to paea a money grant ior e large iaetiral; and the Comelian Lair oi 601
(67 ιι. ο.) iorbade anyone 6ο be lenibus relatae unless bya Senate oi 200 (cp. Amen,
p. 56, Or). For ordinary senatus consulta the minimum was probably much lorer
616610ος but the house wae not counwd out unless some member (Fam. viii. lbi,
Ep. cclxvi.) or the president (Fam. viii. 9, 2, Ep. ccxi: cp. Herzog, op. rit. i. 909)
called attention to the leet that the minimum was not present. Accordingly werre
not surprised to hear that decrees were often ‘snatched’ (ceneten consultans canep-
tnm, Att. x. 4, 9) in a small honae: op. Livy, mix. 4, 6, qni per infrequentem sertia
ceneten consultam jactum ed aerarium detulerit, also Livy, mviii. 44, 6, and Mommsen
St. R. iii. 999, note 4.

Willems (Le δέπαι, ii. 166 ff.) maintains that, as e general rule, there was no exn
minimum required-itis the exception when the minimum is spacihed-and argoas,
that if there was such a fixed minimum, senatus frequrna would hare a tired ard
positive meaning, whereas it has only a relative meaning (cp. Q. Fr. ii. 1, 1, Ep. xciii.
