ADDENDA To THE OOMMENTARK 297

of children aud slaves (exactio capitum atque οοιιοιιιοι, Cic. Fam. iii. 8, b, with reference
to Cilicia; φόρος ἐς) τῇ γῇ καὶ τοῖς σώμασιν, App. Puri„ 135, with reference to
Africa). In accordante with this regulation, the magistrates of each community,
under the superintendenoe of the Roman governor (cio. Q. rr. i. 1. 8. 25; S. C. de
Asclepiade, 22, 23 = Wordsworth‚ p, 208), settled who ware to pay the tar, and what
was to be puid by esch individual (imperata ἐπικιριίλια, uic. Att. v. 18. 2) : if any·
one did not pay this in proper time, his tar-debt was sold just ae at Rome, ς’. e. it was
hnndcd over to a contractor with an adjudication to collect it (venditio tributorum, Cic.
Fam. iii. 8, 5: ὠνὰς omnium conditae, Cio. Att. v. 16. 2).”

On this it may be remarked-(l) that the poll-tax and door-tax (virtuully family·
tax, each family which lived in a house having a separate door: soe Huschke, Omeur
aad Steuaroersaeeuap, N ote 224) are rather to be regarded as special hinda of extortion
practiscd by Appius and the other unscrupuloue governor-s, and sorely felt. We hear
of the poll-tar as continued afterwards in the time oi Hadrian (App. Syr. 80,
καί διὰ ταῦτα ἐστίν Ἰουδαίοις ίίτασιν ί φόρος τῶν σομιίτιιν βαρύτερος τῆς ιίλλης
περιουσίας· ἔστι δὲ καί Σύροις καί Κίλιξιν ἐτήσιος, ἔκατοστὴ τοῦ τιμήματος ἑκάστῳ),
but probably iu a milder form. There were somewhat similar extortiona practised by
Scipio in Asia in 706 (48 ις. o.): see Caesar Bell. Civ. iii. 32, “Interim acerbissime
imperatae pecuniae tota provincia exigebantur. Multa praeterea generatim ad avaritiam
excogitabantur. In capita ιίιιριιὶα servorum ac liberorum tributum imponebatur,
Columnaria, ostiaria, frumentum, milites, remiges, arma, tormenta, vecturae impera·
bantur: cuius modo rei nomen reperiri poterat, hoo satia esse ad cogendae pecunias
videbatur”: op. Aristot. Oec. ii. 25 (1381 a), ἀπ’ οἰκίας δὲ ἑκάστης ἐκέλευσεν ἅπαντας
εἷσένςγκαι τάξαντα ὅ dri καί dard τοῦ σώματος ὣσαιίτοις, under Chabrias iu Egypt: cp.
Marquardt, st. V. ii²‚ 197 ff.¹

(2) The words imperata ἐτικεφιίλια probably referto this extortionatc poll-tax,
and not to the partition among the various individuale of the lump-sum at which each
of the various states was assessed by the Roman rotdomentoffioer.

(3) Mommsen'a view of venditio tubulorum, ὠνὰς annium conditae, seems the right
one. The contractor would pay up the sum at which the States wera accessed, and
afterwards crtort it by degreee with, doubtlcss, a good intereat. There is no need to
suppose, on the basis of App. Mithr. 83,2 that the tax on doore was peculiar to the
Amatio dioceses. It and the poll-tar were rather extortiona oi Appius and those like
him (cp. quam ιιι aaa ἱρτιοναι).
