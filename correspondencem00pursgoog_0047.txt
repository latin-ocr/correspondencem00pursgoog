The man who could write that invective against Antonine
vas net merely a great orator, he was aleo a great personality*;
but just at this period oi hie life he came in oentact with a far
greater personality than himself, with the celebrated Clodia. Ι
‘Tha Palatino Medea,' lately a widow, was leading at this time
a brilliant but wildly dissoluta life. Report maintained that she
had poisoned her husband, and she was considered capable ol any
uime. Rich, cultivated, attractiva, lasciviens, terrible, she was

writers have tehen ae their subject thie brilliant circle, and given

body and substance to the intrigues aud plote, the banquets and
lovels, the maging-parties, and the yaehting parties, the life iu
Clodia’s mansion and gardana on the Palatina and by the
chore and ou the watara at Baiae.† Not even does Cleopatra
