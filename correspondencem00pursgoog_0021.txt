51. OIOERO'S PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT. xvii

the future of Rome was really unfolding 111111 ; 111 him 1111 world
lsy between the Palatino and 1111 Vatioan. ‘Oleava Ruhre, to the
oity, the oity, and in 11111 foous of light feel 11111 you are aliwel
All foreign travelis darkness and diegraoe, lor those whose good
gille oen bear 1111 light 11 Romet'* this is his edvioe 11 hie friend
Caelius as the end of his year of prooonsular government drsws
near. The seme was 1111 tone ol his ary of 1111111, before he had
even 1111111 in his provinoet ‘Words oannol express how I am
oonsumed with longing for the city, how intolerable I find the
insipidity of provinoial life.’† His year of government taught
him nothing ; nor does he seem 11 have observed how very diffe-
rently Caesar regarded his provinoe. Caesar was as anxious for a
renewed lennre of his government of Gaul, 11 Oioero was eager to
111111 the lengthening of his term 11 offioe in 0111111. Caesar saw
11111111 was preparing 1111 way for the Empire in Gaul, while the
Republio was unmaking 111111 in Rome; Oioero was tortured by
the thought 11111, while he was waeling 11111111 hours in Ollinia,
the soram and 1111111111 11 his beloved Rome knew no more 1111
scurra romularis.

Lot us now follow the Journey of Cioero from Rome 11 his
promnoe.

He 1111 Rome early in May, 11. 51 (703). His period of offioe
began on July 1. He did not arrive in Iaodioea 1111 July 30,
Thus he spent nearly three months on 1111 way from Rome to his
provinos. In about half 11111 lime he effeoted his return 11 Rome
on the expiry 11 his year of offioe. His outward journey makes
ns think of Shslrespeare's sohoolboy, oreeping like 111111 unwillingly
11 sehool; he returns 11 Rome in the spirits of a sohoolboy on the
first day of the vaoation. One great eausa of delay was 1111 non·
appenrenoe of his legale Pomptinus. Pomptinos was a breve and
experienoed offioer‚ and was no doubt seleoted by (11111111 view ol
an apprehended 1111111111 from Parthia3 bnt one does not see why
(111111 should have waited days for him 11 every plaoe where he

put up. Pomptinus appears 11 have been as unwilling as Gieero

11 leswe Rome (where Oioero hints 11111 he had an affaire de ooear);
on 1111 other hand, 1111 despateh with whieh he betook himself
