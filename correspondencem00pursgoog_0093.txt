from every quarter, but the roads and villages and harbours were filled with
people feasting and saerifimng. Many too received him with crowns on their
heads and torches in their hands, and, aa they conducted him in processioa
threw flowers upon him, so that his Journey and prcgress was a most beautiful
and splendid spectacle. However this, as much as any other cneumstance,
issaid tc have been one cf the causes of the war. For a prcud spirit entered
into Pompeius, which, combined with the general enthusiasm‚ toolr away the

eccl consideration oi real facts; so that, casting aside that cautious spirit ’

which always leid a firm foundation ior his good fortune and his exploite,
he fell into an unmingled sels-confideres and contempt of Caesar'a powers,
supposing that he would not require arms against Caesar, nor any laborious
exertior, but that he would iar more easily reduce theman tn subjectior than he
had before raised him to eminence. Besides this Appius came from Gaul bring·
ing the legion which Pompeius had lent to Caesar, and mightily depreciated
the actions done there and uttered contemptnous (βλασφήμους) words about
Caesar, decluring that Pompeius himself did not know his own power and glory
in thus wanting to ienee himself round, with other arms against Caesar, ‘ior
yon will (he said) subdue Caesar with hia own legions as scon aa ever you appear ;
ro great ia their hatred cf Caesar and ionging ior yon! At all this Pompeius
war sc elated, and through his confidence became filled with such extravagant
and unbounded contempt of Caesar, that he evenlaugbed atthose who expressed
fear of the war 3 and, when scrne people said that they could not see any forces
to reciet Caesar if he marched against the city, Pompeius, witha smiling and
unruffied ccuntenance (μειδιῶν τῷ· προσύτφ ital διακεχυμένου cp. quam clementer,
Fam. viii. 8. 9, Ep. ccxxiii.) ordered them to set their minda at ease, ‘for
wherever in Italy,' said he, ‘I stamp my foot cu the ground, infantry aud

avurywiuspriugup.’·

Plutarch indeed in another passage (Caes. 29) states thet the
officere who led these troops to Pompeius spread abroad reporta cn
behalf of Caesar which were neither decent ncr honest (οὐκ ἐπιεικεῖς
οὐδὲ χρηστούς), implying that Caesar had told them to tell these
ialsehocds. But be that ss it may, the reporto were spread, and
Pompeius, whc was not very strong either in mind or body in this

crisis, tec readily believed them.

Just before the loth cf December, when Omic's year oi office
would expire, be delivered evigorous speech tc the people in which
he violently declaimed against Pompeius and protested against the
levy as illegal.† When his year ci office was at length finished‚
he left the new tribunes, his own good friend, Marcus Antonium,
