xxx INTRODUOTION.

1611116 48 per oent. whioh was in 1116 bond. Gioero peremptorily
refused to 11116 oogniaanae of sueh a bond, pointing out that the
deoree of the Senate at best only plaoed 1116 oontraot between
Saeptius and the Salaminians 011 the 111116 footing as other eon·
111611, but oould not legaliae a bend in whioh 1116 1616 61 interest
charged was distinetly illegal. Upon this Soaptius gave up all
thoughts of ooeroing his debtors under Gioero’s government, know·
ing perhaps that under his suooessor 116 would probably get what·
ever he demanded, or, possibly, struok witha sudden and shortlived
eompunotion. (1611616666 is sometimes eeen to 11116 up her sbode
fora short sojourn in 1116 most unexpeoted quarters. For the
present he only asked that the matter should be allowed to drop,
and that the Salaminians should not be permitted to deposit the
money in 6 temple, whioh they were ready to do; for the effeot of
this would be that the interest would oense to aoorue, and Scaptius
did not wish to diminish the sum whioh he probably hoped to
extort under Oieero’s suooessor.

By this time Giaero had disoovered thst Brutus was the real
oreditor; indeed, the gentle Brutus had urged (116616 to eonfer on
Soaptius the preleoture whioh he had refused him, and whioh
Scaptius bad made so effective in the bloohade of the Senate
House; and had written several letters offensive in tone complain-
ing of his advooaoy of 1116 rights of the Salaminians. Euan
Attious now begs his deor friend to let Saeptius have a troop of
horse, only a little one, just fifty swords, whioh he felt sure would
make the Salaminians see reason. It 11 pleasant to observa that

(116616111161111)1 as indignant as we feel 6111161161 11 the audaoity

‘What’ he writes· ‘you, Attious, make sneh a requestf Yon, the eulogist
of my integrity and moral purismf Are 11616 tte lips to dore, as Ennius says,
to ask me 16 give Saeptiur a troop oi horsa to ooeroe his debtora? Only fifty,
you say. Why, Spartacus had no more at first! -

However, the issue of the whole matter was some eonaession to
injustioe on the part of eioero. He prevailed on the Salaminians,
as a favour to himself, to let the matter rest for the present, and
not to deposit the money. He salved his oonsoienoe by appealiug
