Caelius returned from Spain neither a richer nor a wiser man.
He was gradually beginning to see that Caesar was not hy any
means going to carry out the extreme radicel programma, abolish
debts and generally turn society upside down: and if so, why in
the world was Marcus Caelius Rufus lending him his potent
assistance? The whole world was ungrateiul, and, what was
worse, oreditors were as likely as ever to be able to enforce their
claime. But Caesar was not at all ungratelu13 he paid Caelius
what he thought he was worth, by bestowing on him the praetor·
ehip for 706 (48); but he did not leave to lot es was the
oustom the decision who should gettha urban praetorship, but
nominated to that post the wisa and iudicione Gaius Trebonius.
This man hed serwed ansar faithfully as one oi his lieutenanta
for some years, and he was one on whom Caesar could thoroughly
rely, to carry out his enactments cs regards debt; while he could
not rely on a man so deeply sunk in money difficulties, and ol so
excitable a temper, as Caclius. This was the last straw. Dis·
appointed at every turn, a complete alien to the Pompeiane,
furious at the cool insolenoe of many oi his party, no enthusiastio
Caesarian, and, what was more galling, one oi little account,
(laelius would seem to have lost his mental balance. His anger got
the better not only oi his good sense but even of his reason. 'Phe
extraordinary serenteenth letter oi the collection, written in March
706 (48), shows us clearly enough that Caelius’ mind was actually
unhinged. Itis nothing but wcak regrets and silly boastings,
expressed in inooherent language.

‘It was hatred of Appius Claudius and love of Curio that made me a
Caesarium now too lete 1 see that my good sense was blinded by hate and
love. You should have warned me: you neglected your duty as my friend.
Not that 1 mistruat the final victory of Caesar's oeuse; no, but it is better
to die than to bear the sight of these men. Everyone here is a Pompeian
except a few usurers. It is I who have made, not merely the plebeians,

⁴ Fam. viii. 14. 3, Ep. cclxxx. It is s profound remark of Becher (p. 6) that
Caelius, lor ull his passionateness oi temper and language, would never heve made a
satirist; he lached that enthusiasm for ideals, and that belief iu tha moral law, which
turn the mere deolsimer into the genuine reformor.
