xxiv INTRODUC'TION.

epooh of history leade Mommsen 10 compare the Roman State in

Asia 10 the Ηο11 Reman Empire 01 the German nation, had
plotted with Athenaie, the mother 01 Ariobarzanes, 10 depose
him andplace hie brother Ariarathes on 1110 throne Ariobarzanes
cameto Cicero 11 Cybistra, and detailed to him with 10111 the
whole plot, which his brother Ariarathes had discloesd to him
with a high-mindednees very 1110, especially among Orientale.
010010 0101100 10011011 himself the 1010 conduct 01 the affair. He
brought back the faithful ministare 01 the King, Metrae and
Athenaeus, who had been dismissed through the machinatione 01
Athenaie and Archelaus, and persuaded the latter 10 abandon hie
ambitione projecte.

‘To me,' he writes, 10 Atticm, ‘Ariobarzanes owse his 11110110,
hie very life'* Yet his public despatchse brsathe a spirit 01
complete eslf-effaoement. Hs has nothing 10 say abent 1 trans·
action ae least as creditable 10 him as the expleit 01 hie consulship.
Perhaps he did not wish to advertise 100 much hie suppression 01
Archelaus, who was a 01001110 01 Magnus. More probably he
knew that euch was the 11010 01 public opinion in Rome that a
proconsul who eought 10 (10 good would not be 11110 10 101 hie light
ehine before men. It was only 10 Atticus he eould venture 10
confide a fact which would have been received by an Appius with
incredulity 01 indignation.

The whole history 01 Cicero'e proconsulate is the history 01 1
struggle between his conscience and his desire 10 meet the 110111 01
0101111011, especially the publicane 0111 the great men 11 Reme.
Strngglee 01101 cause 0 displacsment 01 0011011011 drapery, and so
we find that the curtain, which hid the doings 01 the magnates 01
thie period, ie sometimes 101 0 moment pushed 01110, 011 1110111 1
glimpse 01 what is going on behind it. A meet amusing letter,
when one reads between the lines, ie cne† in which Cicero begs
1111111011 Thermus, pro-praetor 01 Bithynia, 10 11101011 himself
11 the business 00100111 01 Cluvius 01 Puteoli. These 00100111 010

and kinge have well-nigh mortgaged their 01011110 him. Who
isthie mammoth financier, 01 whom, however, history has 10 1011
little 10 say? The anewer to this question elipe ont in the laet
