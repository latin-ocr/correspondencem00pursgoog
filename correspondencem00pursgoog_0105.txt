In Part Ι. 5 2 ve endeavoured to give a shetoh of the ⁸ .
ehmaeterietiee of (laelius, and we found him to heve been ahot-
headed, violent speaker, very elever at applying niohnames3 but
(thoughhe is saidtohave devoted a good deal oi aare tohis speeohes)
he was too munh earried avvay by the vehemenae of his temperament
to be very oarehrl in the ohoioe of his words or in the elaboration of
hie periods. There is only one letter of his inthe oolleotion which
ean be said to be literary, vin. the sixteenth,vvhioh he wrote to Oioero
in the hope of persuading him to remain in Italy, and not join the
Pompeian party in Greeee. Indeed‚ Caelius did not aim at being
literary, for he purposely ohose a style of oratory and of writing
whieh eavoured of the language of the people and of familiar
conversation; accordingly we frequently find in his writings the
phraseology oi the oomediee. Later writers said that (laelius was
erehnie in style3 bnt it was the langnage oi eommon life around

him whieh he affected, rather than the diotion ol Cato and

Plautus; though he sometimes made an affort, and rose to the
full height of powerfnlness‚ whieh the great Latin language el

his times permitted.† The author of the Dialogus on Oratore did
not love the eneients. ‘Sunt enim (so. antiqui oratores)‚' he says
(e. 18), ‘horridi et impoliti et rudes et informes et quos utinam

nulle parte imitatus esset (lalvus vester aut (laelius aut ipse
Oioero'3 and aooordingly he pasees a severe judgment on (laelius
(e. 21), ‘Quina ex Caelianis orationibus nempe eae planant sive
universae sive partes earum, in quibua nitorem et altitudinem
horum temporum adgnosoimne. Sordes autem illae verborum
(“vnlgar expressione'') et hians eompositio et ineonditi senem
(“ unoonth sentenees '') redolent antiquitatem nee quemquam adeo
