Being aedile, (laelius was required to give shows, aud asked (lioero
to geta oontribution in money from the provinoials in Gilioia for the
purpose, and also to prooure some panthera. It does not appear to
have been at all unusual to make requesta for suoh oolleotions of
money, at least if we may judge from a passage in oue of Oioero’s
letters to his brother (Q. Fr. i. l. 26, Ep. xxx.); but Oioero point-
blank refused it, and gave Caeliusa leoture to the effeot that one so
ready to attaek others should not leave himself so very open to
retaliation.*

While the great question about Gaesar’s reoall was dragging
along, (laelius, in order that the State might not die of lethargy,†

matters, ‘could have been more exhaustive or better.’ (See note
on Ep. ooxlii. 4).

Some time later than this, iu September, 704 (50), Caelius

ward of patriciana, Appius Claudius Puloher, who was now Censor,
and was with great ponderousness playing the part of the ‘uueo
guid! (laelius had done Appius some servios when the latter was
impeaehed by Dolabella, and thinking (foolishly) that Appius might
dohim a good turn, appears to have asked him for the loen of some
money. Appius was not in the least grateful; on the eontrary his
perverse nature hadbegun to hate the man who had rendered him a
servios: and he accordingly refused Caelius, probably with a leeture
on his extravagauoe. Now it may be that a woman is most
