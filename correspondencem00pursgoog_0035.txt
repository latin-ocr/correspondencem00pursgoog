to (lato, who does not appear to heve condemned Brutus. So
Osto, we observe, in spite 01 the loss—perhaps by reason 01 the
loss-of the aeeounts in re King Ptolemy, holds the position ol
moral oensor and general referee 10 matters 01 moral and peouniary
reatitude.

We 011 know how strong was the republican spirit in the noble .
Brutus. We read that he

‘would have brook’d
The 0100001 10011 10 keep state in Rome
As eadly es 0 king?

But with an Asiatie Majeety he was not above doing a little
business, 11 0 few millions 01 0001θο000 were to bs turned honestly
-or otherwise. We find him inoessantly plying Oioero with
0011011011οο0 10 0000000 001 01 the wretohed Ariobarzanes moneys
whioh the King owed him. Even Pompeius shewed meroy. He
sooepted thirty-three Attio 1010010 0 month, and this ‘did not
make up the amount 0111000000110101 interest’ But Pompeius
100001001 with this instalment 01 the interest, 001 10 00110101 10
iorego the eapitel. Not so the noble Brutus. Η10 importunities
are so wearying that Oioero thinks 01 giving up 011 attempta 10
0001001 the King or manage his affairs. Atticus, however, per·
susded him to maintain his guardianship. Oioero suooeeded 011001
ingelting from the King 100 1010010100 Brutus, who ‘haerseovered
more money than Pompeius, in 0000001100 10 the amount 01 110
loan’ Yet Brutus does not oease to write disoourteous letters
olsmouring 100 more. Verily,

ιΗ101110 was gentle, 001 the elements
So mix’d in him that nature might stand up
And say 10 011 the world, Thia was a man! '

Charaoters given by biographers have often to be read, 1110

sufficiently 1000101, hut rarely are the ohsraoters aetually inter·

There 10, however, one 0001001 testimony about the oharaoter
