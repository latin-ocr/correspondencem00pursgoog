§L Olosada PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT. xxi

praetioa of his predeoess013 aongratulating the wild beast on the
prospeot ot the triumph ‘whioh he so well deserves3’ finally,
apologizing for the part which his son-in·law Dolabella took in
proseouting Appius, hearinghis testimony in favour of the aooused

aud oongratulating him on the righteous verdiot whioh aequitted
him. Surely never was a Dalilah more oruel in the saarifioss
exaoted from her adorer than was the Republio whioh Oieero had
made hia idol.

It was his own natural refinement oi spirit, and not any large
and insistent sympathy with the subjeots, whioh made his admin-
istration so gentle and pure. 'Phough ‘tortured' by the slightest
indiscretion on the part of his staff, his oonaern lor the provinciale
seems absolutely bounded by the limits of his own offioial respon·
sibility. He did not hesitats to leave his province in the hands of
a person whom he knew to be as unprinoipled as Appius. The
probable brutalities of a sueoessor gave him no oonaem. Nay‚
might they not even heighten by oontrast the ekyaotio of his own
mle? This word, whieh reours so often in the letters ol this
period, puta in a nutshell the eharaoter oi Oiosro’s administration,
its motiva and its result, or rather its want of result. He did not
look at his provinoe from ansar's point of view, as portion and
paroel oi a great disorganized mass ol eommunities linked for
better or worse with the destinies ol imperial Rome, and fated for
better or worse to deoida her future. He regarded it merely as a
stage on whioh he might strat ior an hour, and then dismiss it
from his thoughts for ever. His administration held the sama
relation to a really enlightened rule aa dandyism bears to oleanli·
nese, and perhaps no better phrase than ‘moral dandyism' oonld
ba found to express the meaning ol that elegantia for whioh he so
often elaims eredit.

It is amusing to observa how the oounsels of perfeetion with
vvhiah he started begin to yisld when donfronted with the stern
rsalities oi praetioal experienae. He had told Attious that he
meant to introduoe into his ediot a olauae from theediot of Bibulus,
undertaking to maintain all agreements between the publieans and
the provinciola, ‘provided no ioroe or fraud had been used to pro·
eure the oontraet.’ But we leam from another letter* that Attious
