298 ADDENDA 1¹0 THE COMMENYABY.

1v.-Lnx PUPIA.

Tain- there were certain days ou which it wss not lawful to hold the Senate 11 sostei
by Varro in the yeer 603 (71 n. c.) : cp. Gell. xiv. 7, 9, Doeat (sc. Varro) deinde eries
malm quibus dicim baini unctum iae non ait, Now, we know such were 111
necessarily festivals, 111 1 sitting was held on the Carmentalis xvi. Kal. Feb. 698 (bt

meeting 11 the Senate was held on such a dsy, wia. im 1111111115θό (169 mot:
Lis. xliv. 20, 2. Further, that the hindrances were not 11 the nature 11 religione onesii
certain from the expression 111 non sit (cp. Herzog, Rem. discussissem, i. 910). In
short, we cannot be certain to what days Varro is alluding.

But perhaps they were dies comitiales, days 11 which the comitia could be held =
This certainly seems very natural, 111 11 would prevent any clashing between 111
1111111111,11111111111111111111111 could not be in two places at once. And 1 certain
incompatibility did subsist between the dies comitiales aud the sittings 11111 Senam
on some dica comitiales the Senate could not beheld (maeoti eunt dies comitiales per l
quos senatos haberi non poterat, 011. Q. Fr. ii. 2. 3, Ep. 1.). But theru were m ³
comitia] days on which the Senate could be held, 11 is perhaps implied in this very
passage, and this iniereuce is further supported by the direct evidence that the Senam
did meet on dies consitioloa, e. g. prid. Kal. 01111703 (11 n· 1.), 011. Fam. viii 8,1
Ep. ccxxiii. There appears theu to hare been a certain amount 11 competibiiity md
a certain amount 11 incompatibility between the dies comitiales and the sittings 11 111

Originally, 11 Karlowa (Rem. 11111111111111111, p. 364) supposes, in all probability
it wes ouswonary that no sittings 11 the Senate should be held on dies comitiales ‚· bag
there being no toyol restrictiori to that effect, 1111111111 times oi the Republic 11111
11111111 began to be 1111 from violatiou 111111 custom; and an attempt was 11111111
111 111 days on which it would and the drys on which it would not be leyat to hold the
Seuate. This was done by the Lex Pupia, a law about which we have not very explicit
1111111111, and the terma oi which can only be conjectured.

Iunge (11111. Α 11. 111.191)1111111111 thet it iorbade the holding 11 the Seuate on any
dieo comitialis, et any rate till the Comitia were dismissed: cp. Dio. Cass. xxxvii 43ς
011. 111. 1. 11, b, Ep. xx. The Comitia had the 11111 claim 11 1 oen comitialis ,· 1111
claim satisfied, whether it happened that the Comitia were not held or were finished or
adjourned, the Senatu might meet. A resolution oi the senate possed ἡμέρᾳ μὴ eoo„-
