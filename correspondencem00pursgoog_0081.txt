But that did not satisfy him; he 11101 010010 fresh grievances. It

innocent, simple-minded aet; and we Romana should indulge them, tor their error, such

or not. With the exception of two short letters 01 Cicero written 10 him in 704 (10)
ria. Fam. xiii. 2. 3, Epp. cclix„ 00111, and Curio's proposed law that he should he
restored from exile, we hear no more about Memmius.

Hc appears 1011010 been a good specimen ot the ordinary active politieian 01 his

oithose aronud him. He was a very proud Roman noble, his family tracing its origin to
Trojan times (Serv. 011101. v. 117), and testiiying 10110 antiquity by stamping the head
oi Romulus on their coins. Mommsen (op. eit. ii. p. 514) sees in this claim the point

not appear to have 11000110 achiba till a comparatiyely late period. This pride 01 birth,
however, which they affected, no doubt made Cicero very 0010111 aa regards the tone he
adopted in writing to Memmius. (110010, in another place (Brut. 247), speaks 01 him
aa well-wersed in Greek literature but despising Latia, aud as a woluble and pleasing
speaker, hut as one who did not taire any trouble about his speaking, or ewen about
wnsidering what he was going to say. Like so many oi his contemporaries he

judged to be ‘rough’ (dura) productione (Gall. rix. 9. 1). Lucretius addressed tha Da
1101101 Natura to this Memmium and Martha (p. ol) thinks that the many fine
passages in that poem referring to the miserias 01 ambition crespeeially addressed to
him. Munro remmia that it is notieeable that on 011 the coins oi the Memmii we find
Venas erowncd by Iove, which gives special point to the lines i. 26·27: Memmiadae
