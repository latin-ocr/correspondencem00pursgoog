lxxviii IN PRODUOYION.

when circumstances required it; and suchintercalary month (called
Mercedonius) was generally inserted aster February 24th. Curio
was a pontifex, and represented as a matter of course, that the
month should bc inserted3 for his important laws required
time to be carried through, and after March lst the question
of the succession to the provinces would claim preoedenoe. He
urged his view with the greatest violence, browbeating his follow·
pontifices with shouts and ories (καὶ τοὺς correptor ὅσον ἀπὸ βοῆς
ἐξεβιάζετο, Ι)ἰο xl. 62). He did not want the month inserted3
but he wanted to get a pretext to oppose the Pompeian fection,
and his whole policy was to represent himself es a martyr. No
one seems to have pereeived what object Curio was aiming at; χ
even the elever Caelius (Fam. viii. 6. 5, Ep. ccxlii.) characterizes
his whole conduct as most feather·brained (musitae). Memorat,
there was adesire among politicians to come to the burning question
of the succession to the provinces as soon as possible, and the
insertion of the intercalary month was not made. Curio, in a l
simulated rage, goes regularly over to thedemocracy and begins to
speak foricaesar, continuing his campaign of legislation by pro·
posing alaw about the distributione of corn, that they be made by
the aediles, and also an enaotment about the maintenance of the ἶ
roads, which, like the agrarian law of Rullus, was to give Ourio '
himself a commissionemhip of Roads fortiva years* If that did
not reuse the Pompeiane, nothing would. Cicero appears to have
been partly grieved, but also a little amused, at this volte-sace of
Curio. “ The slipen which you wrote the postscript in your
own handwriting gave me a stab (pupugit), What? Gurio
now defending Caesar? Who would ever heve thought it except
myself? For on my life I did think it.† Heavens! how Ι do
miss the laugh we might have over it (di iacenter-tolca quam cyo risam

nostrum desidero .!).' ss

The first of March came; but the consul Paullus who had the
foeces this mouth, postponed the debete on the provinces, perhaps
in the intereste oi Ourio. He may also have played into Ourio’s

hand by apparent opposition, as he seems to have deprived him of
several comitial days by various appeals to the artifices ol the
