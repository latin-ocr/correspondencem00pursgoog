51. OIOEBO'S PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT. xxvii

urst among the rising generation, soon, l hope, to be the first man
in the suu? ¹³ His connections were certainly favourable for the
nchievement of that position. Desoended from one of the most
illustrious families of Rome, nephew of (lato, brother-in·law of
Lepidus and Cassius, he oould hardly point to a great house with
which he was not linlred. The moral austerity and sooial purity .
which distinguished the young Brutus did not extend to his family
circle. The passion of his mother Servilia for Caesar was no secret
at Rome, and has been held by some to add a new significanoe to
the words ascribed to the dying Dictator, καὶ σύ, τέκνον. Servilia
iseven said to have essayed to maintsin her influenee over Caesar
by encouraging an intrigue between him and her daughter, the
wile of Caesius. That her other daughter, the wife of Lepidus,
‘'soaped not calumnious strokes' is revealed by an amusing inei·
dent related by Oioer0.† Among the goods of one Vedius, which
were by ohanoe included among the aseets of Pompeius Vindullus
on the death of the latter, were found images or pertrait models
of certain Roman ladies, whose characters would naturally suffer
from the disoowery, as Vedius was a man of the woret character.
“ Among these pertraits was one oi J unia, sister of Brutus and wife
of Lepidus. Lepidus took no notioe of the matter, and Brutus
did not feel called upon to break off his intimacy with Vedius.
Cicero, with a characteristic play upon the two names, Brutus
(‘ dull, insensate 'J and Lepidus (‘ gay, pleasant '), thus relates the
insident :-

‘Among the belongings of Vedius (accidentally included in the assets of
Vindullus) were found five pertraits of Roman ladies, among them a pertrait of
the sister of your friend Brutus-a brute part in him to keep up the fellow's
acquaintance-and wife of Lepidus—pleasant fellow indeed to take the matter

so ooolly.'‡

1‘In quibus una sororis amici tui hominis Bruti qui hoc utatur et uxoris illius
lepidi qui haec tam neglegenter ferat! Very noticeable in this sentence is the ex-
tremely delicate usa of the subjunctive mood, which is the sole vehicle of the johe ; the
indicau‘re would have merely stated as a fact thet Brutus did not cut Vedius, and that
lapidus made light of the affair. Hamlet makes a similar play on the name Brutus :-

‘Paesto-1 did enact J ullus Caesar. I uus killed in the Capitel; Brutus killed
