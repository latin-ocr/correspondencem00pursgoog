xviii INTRODUOTION.

baelr to Rome makes even Oioero's return journey seem slow by
0000ρο01000. What with waiting 100 Pomptinus, and spending
three days at Tarentum in 0001000000 with Pompeius 00 affairs
of state, Oieero did not arrive at Brundisium till May 22. Thon,
again, where was Pomptinus? How oould one leave Italy without
Pomptinus? Moreover, the weather was not inviting, and Oieero
was not very well. In short, J une had begun before he set sail-
without Pomptinus. The voyage to Aetium, broken at Goreyra
and Sybota, where Gieero and his auita ι10001001 like aldermen’*
with Areus and Eutyohides, friends 01 Α111000, oeoupied about a
fortnight. The next stage was to be Athens. The route by sea
was mueh shorter, but it was tiresome, and ‘it would 001 10010 well
10 arrivs with so small a fletilla' It was better to take the longer
00010 by land. They did so, and arrived at Athens 10 100 days,
J une 24th. Again we are surprised 011100 intelleotual apathy 01
010000. Ηο 10οᾶ 001 seen Athens sinae he was little more than a
hey, yet the eity suggesta to him nothing but the 1001 that hio
friend Attieus used 10 live there, and his thoughts fly baek te
Rome, Caesar’s debts, Milo's embarrassments, the 0000000010· 01 the
sorem and the basilicae. In 1001, 11 dees 001 appear thet he would
have made any sojourn in Athens at all, eroept 01 course beoause
one must wait 100 Pomptinus. Here, however, Oioero found him·
self obliged 1ο renew an aequaintauee with 000 who belonged to a
elass eharaeteristie 01 soeiety just 101000 1101011011100 Republie.
The notorious Memmius, 000 01 110 parties 10 the infamous oom-
poet made with the outgeing 0000010 10 54, (700)1 was now
living in Greeee, an exile. He had beeome possessed oi seme
premises hallewed 100 the Epieureans hythe 1001 11001 they had
0000 belonged 10 the Master himself. The diseiples 01 Epieunrs,
Patro and others now living in Athens, beseught the good offiees
01 (110000 with Memmius, 10 seoure 100 them these premises.
Memmius is hut little eonoerned. The poem whioh Lueretius

dedieated to him does 001 seem 10 have awalrened in him any
interest in Epieurus 00 1010 house. Perhaps he had never read the
poem. Oioere tells usss that Memmius was ‘thoroughly versed in
literature, but only in Greek literature; Latin he despised.' We
000 gratifisd (perhaps more than (lieero was) 10 find Pomptinus at

'Saliareminmodum Att v. 9. 1 (0000). †Att. iv. ll.2(exlix.). 1Βο01247.
