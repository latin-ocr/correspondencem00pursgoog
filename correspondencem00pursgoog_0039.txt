not to assume the offensive, not to eross the Euphrates, but to take
up hia position in some strong plsoe, and watoh the movements oi
the enemy. Cassius, whose name is generally liuked with Brutus
as a kind of foil to his lustre, or at best as but a humble admirer of
virtues quite uuattainable by himself, seems to have been about
the most respeetable of those blustering impostore who strut aoross ·
the dage in the last soene of Rome's Republio. Phough Brutus
taunts him with his ‘itehing palm,' he was a model oi uprightness
eompared with his oensor, and at the orisis of the threatened
Parthian attaolr be saved his oountry trom the possible reeurrenee
ol the disaster of Carrhae. Oieero bears witness to this, though
he oharaoteristioally ascribes most of the eredit to himself τ ‘When
my approaoh got wind, Cassius took heart and the Parthians were
paniostrielren. They fell baelr from the town (Antioeh). Cassius
followed them and aohieved a suoeess. In the flight Osaoes,
a leading Parthian ohieftain, reoeived a wound ot whioh he died a
few days after. My name oam'es great weight in Syria! ³ He
aoknowledges‚ in a letter to Cassius himselt,† that the latter had
really gained an important victory. Yet, writing to Attieus,‡ he
eharaoteriaes aa impudent the letter in which Cassius olaims to
have foiled the Parthian attaok. In the same humour Oioero
ridioules the attempt oi Bibulus to seeure a triumph by rivalling
his own exploit on Mount Amanus, and says that ‘he is looking
ior his bays in a laurel·oake.'§ But he is well aware that his own
aobievements will hardly till the trump of fame. When he an·
uounees to Atticus the fall ot Pindenissus, he adds: ll ‘Who the
plagae, you will say, are the Pindenissitae? I never heard of
them before. Phat is not my fault. Gould Ι transform Oilioia
into an Aetolia or MaoedoniaP' For this suooeas he was saluted
Imperator by the soldiers ou the field ol battle, and afterwards the
Senate voted a supplioation in his honour. He would probably
have gained a triumph but ior the ungenerous opposition ol Cato,
who, however, supported the mueh inferior elaims ot his sou-in-law
Bibulus to a similar honour. Oioero undoubtedly shewed oou·
siderable military ability. He found himself oontronted, imme·
