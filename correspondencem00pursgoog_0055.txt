§2 MARCUS CAELI Ua RUFUS. li

Bauli in Campania, where he appears to have lived in great
poverty? Valeriae Maximus (iv. 2. 7) tells a story ol the sequel

of this trial, whioh shows the eharaater of Caelius in a good light.
'l'he mother of Pompeius Rufus was Cornelia, daughter of Sulla.
She would not return to her son in his mistortune some property
antrustod to her sale-heeping. Pompeius had the magnanimity to ’
write to anlius to ask his help in this matter. Even aleas im·
pulsive nature than that of anhus oould not have refused suoh a
requae-a violent politioal opponent, who had direotly oaused
auothar’s exile, is appaaled to by that exile to help him against
his unnatural mother. We are told, and oan well believe it, that
Caelius advooated his oase with the utmost persistenoy (pertinacia-
ar'me), and read to the oourt a letter from Pompeius to show the
diro struite to whioh the latter had been reduced—and we are

glad to hear that he aohieved a complete suooess, ‘an aot,' says
Valerius, ‘whioh on aooount ol its remarkable generosity and
follow-feeling is not to he disregarded even though done by a

Coelius' (proptor eximiam humanitatem ne sub Coelio peridem rapu·
dianetum).

In August ol this year 702 (52) the law ealled that of the Ten
Tribunos was passed notwithstanding the violent opposition of
(lato. We shall have oooasion to speak of it in the next sertion.
Here wo allude to it only to notioa that Caelius had intended to
veto it; for with his far-sightedness in politiae he saw then, as
(linaro did afterwards, that it was an enaotment fraught with the
greatest danger to the Senatorial party. It was the seed, says
lange (R. A. iri. 369), from whioh tho Oivil War sprang. But
Pompeius, delighted for the present to be rid of Caesar, eom-
misaioned Gioero to &suade Caelius from the oourse he had
intended to pursue,† and the law passed as that ol the Ten
Tribunos.

Caelius' oorrespondenoe with Oioero begins in tho middle of
703 (51). At that time (laelius was oanvassing for the oumle
aedileship‚ his oompetitors being Octavius and Hirrus. The
tormer was sure of eleotion: the latter was a ridioulous though
not altogether uninfluential personss Caelius is always gibing at

‘cia Fam. viii. l. 4, Ep. oxeii. †cic. Att. vii. 1.4, Ep. oelxxxiv.
