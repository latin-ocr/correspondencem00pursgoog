(Fam. viii. ll. 3, Ep. mlxvii). Aooordingly the view whioh Curio,
atthis time ostensibly an independent demoorat, adopted was that
0010 Pompeius aad ansar should resign simultaneously. The
majority of the Senate were in favour 01 0 compromise between

the view 01 the extreme 001001001001100 1001000001 should resign

on Marah lst, ss was nominated in the law, and the more indul· -

gent proposal 01 Pompeius, whioh fixed November 13th. They
said, 101 him retire 00 July lst, whioh will give a 0100001000
during whioh he 000 be present and oanvass for the oonsulship 10
due form* Curio vetoed this motion, insisting on his point that
both should resign simultaneously3 only thus (he urged) oould the
atmosphere 01 politiae be oleared and all apprehension removed-
an astion whioh gained him suoh popularity that, when he 1011 the
Senatehome, the people threw flowers upon him ‘as upon a vio·
toribus athlete.'† The Senate, however, were so lukewarm in
their opinions that they rejeoted by a lenge majority the proposal
01 Maroallus that pressure should be put on Ourio to make him
retraot his veto. ‘By that vote,' writes (laelius (Fam. viii. 13, 2,
Ep. solui), ‘they showed that they had oome round 10 the view
that regard should be'paid to the oandidature 01 000 who gives up
neither army nor provinoe. How Pompeius will bear this Ι shall
write when I know. What 10 to hoppen to the State if Pompeius
assumes the offensive or lets things elide-why, you rioh old
gentlemen must see to that?

Preeently there arrived two letters addressed to the Senate.
One was from Bibulus sehing for 0 supplicatio. 00 the motion 01
0010 11 was granted lor twenty daysss 0000100 had oertainly
repulsed the Parthians ‘under the auspioes' 01 Bibulus, long
before the latter arrived3 Bibulus himself haddone absolutely

nothing exoept lose some ospable offioers anda eohort or so; ‘how-
ever on earth he did it in the total absenoe 01 the Parthians*
