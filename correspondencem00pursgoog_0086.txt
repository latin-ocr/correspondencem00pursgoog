puzaled 00011110 (Fam. viii. 6. 4, Ep. 0011111).ι In 1110 1101101
fashion 110 shut himself up, 11110 time in a well-fartified and well·

provisioned town, and stayed 111010 while the slightest rumour
subsistad that the Parthians vvere still in his province. He does

not appear to have aven observed 1110 heavens or issued Archilo-
ohian adiots.† But he was 0 sale vote 10 tho extreme party

against Gaesar3 therein lay the Perfeot Wisdom3 and 1ο an
orthodox Staio like Cato, that 01 course guaranteed military
efficienoy, personat ocurage, and 0111110 other virtues.

Τ110 other was from Pompeius. It was an able and judicions
letter, owing 10 110 apparent moderatiori. He 1100 willing to
101110 before his 111110 from command 01 his army if the State
should require it; 0111 therein 1100101 more constitutional 111011
(100001,111101100 not willing to 101110 even long after his legal
tenure 01 governorship should expire. Pompeius stated the same
on his return 10 Romaiu June. But Curio had a ready reply.
These were 011 mere promises. Lat 10111 retire 01 toth hold their
armies: hy no other means could the equilibrium 01 parties be
preserved, and the State remain sate-and Ourio waa able 10 urge
this with irresistible 10100, 101 11 was the simple 110111. Cato,
ccurageous aa 0101, tried 10 hold popular maetings and 10 put
the Senate's 0000 before the people; but he 01100101 nothingss

During May there 1100 0 1011010 on the sending 01 1011110100·
ments 10 Syria 10 face the threatened Parthian invasion. Curio,
who would seem to have got into 1110 habit 01 instinctively vetoing
every proposal, vetoed this; 00 he did also 0 motion granting pay
10 Pompeius’ soldiers. But he gave up the opposition next mouth,
and was considered 10 have acted wisely in doing 00. It was then
1001001 that both Caesar and Pompeius should give each 0 legion
101 Syria. Pompeius 001101 back the legion which he had lent 1ο
Caesar. Caesar at once returned it and sent 0100 the filteenth legion
01 his own army, 01101 giving officere 0111 00111010 01 both large
rewards and thanking them 101 their 00111000. These legions were
stationed at Capua and not sent to Syria at all—a circumstance
which was used to 1001011 0 charge 01 bad 101111 on the Pompeiano.
