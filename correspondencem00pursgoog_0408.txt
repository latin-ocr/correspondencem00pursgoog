296 ADDENDA 1¹0 THE COMMENTARY.

evidence which was procnred frorn the provinces must be lodged with the praetor, uel

Flacc. 21, schol. bob, p. 238, Orelli :aare enim habiatur, ut manre· ds
pecuniis repetundis sennia inetmmenta tabularum et intra dim milace ad pamm
desmmt et cannia sudeam anulis obsequerentur. 'l'he accuser also, when going out tc
collect evidence, could only bring a certain number of compacions withhim(1eyelce
recenti at noea,¹ Flacc, 13). Cicero (Flaco, 82) further informe us that aeccrdmgto
this law the time of accusation and defcnoe in cases cf repetendae was shortcned,sir
hours apparently being allowed to the prosecutor and nine to the defendant (cp. Plin
Epist. iv. 9, 9).

The law remained in force during the Empire, and ie commented on in the Dignst
(48, ll), and tha Codes (Just. 9, 273 Theodos. 9, 27). As falling underthls law the
jurists especially emphasise many forms of judicial corruption, ap. in giving evidence,
in appointing arbitrators or judges, in estimating damages, in passing sentences, dc,
also corruption exhibited in giving retes in the denote for money, in the reeruitingof
soldiers, and in the matter of public contractu, e. p. ifthe contrcet was given at too high
a price owing to corruption of the official who gave the connect, orif the contractor
declnrcd the work tc be finished when it was not properly fluished. The punishment
was fourfold restitution, with an action against the heirs (Cod. Just. 9, 27, 12); sorne-
times expulsion from the Senate (and such a degreded senator could not be a J'ndge or
awitnees, Dig. l, 9, 2: cp. Suet. Jul, 43); and in more serione cases exile, oreren
death (Dig. 48, 11, 7, 3).
