xxxiv INTRODUCTION.

1 had any commanda, and in fact showed undisguised dmcourtesy to me. What
would you think cf mc ii Ι kept such a fellcw on my stati? Wac I, who never
broched insolencc from the highest, to endure it from a hunger-cn like this?
Well, this Gavius, seeing me again when he was setting cut for Rome, asksd
me in a tone which 1 should not have ventured tc use to a Culleolns: ‘⁴ To
arbom cm I to look for my allcwcocer 2³³ Ireplied, with less asperity thau
the circumstances justified in tho opinion ci the bystanders, “I cm oct in tte
habit os making allowanccc to those robore terrim 1 do aot require.” He went
away in a rege! Cicero adds, ‘If the complaints of the sacundrel have any
effect cn Brutus, Ι give him up. In your admiration for him you will have no
rival in ma’

Buta certain inconsistency in the conduct oi Cicero shows
itself in these letters. He constantly expresses dissutisfaction with
friends cf his who send out to him needy adventorem and political
or forensia failures to make a fortune in his province, yet this was
the very thing which he himself did in the case of Trebatius. He
strongly recommended him to Cacsar, and did not conceal that he
hoped Trebatius would enrioh himself in Caul. We have already
seen him defending, so far as he could, the provinciale from the
rapacity of the publicans3 yet we find him writing to Crassipes,
quaestor of Bithynia: recommending to him the interests oi the
Bithynian Company, and oounselling all those acts cf favouritism
to the publicans which were habitual with Roman govemors, but
which were avoided and condemned by himself in his own person
and his own province.

'Phe military ability displayed by Cicero in his proconsulato
was very considerable. Indead, both as a poet and as a general
Cicero had iar highcr aptitudes than he is generally accredited
with. Cf course we meet in the letters describing his campaign
that quality which hc candidly ascribes to himself in a letter to
Atticus,† ‘that little strain of vanity aud touch of cbcoa'arbm

which is in my character,' adding, ‘’tis well not tc shut one's eyes
to one's own foibles' He underrates the aohievement of Cassius,
who really overted the Parthian invasion which Cicero appre-
hended. Cassius had faocd the Parthian before. He had tahon
part in the fatal day of Carrhae-a disaster which might have been
averted if Crassus had adopted the prudent oounscl of his quaestor,
