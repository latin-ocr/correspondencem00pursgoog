vi PREFA OE.

the received order3 but we have not done so unless the evidence
eesmed to be of a strong and positive kind. We have en-
deavoured in thie, as in other matters, to profit by the kindly
adviee of our reviewere, lor whose sympathy and enoouragement
we would here express our lively sense of gratitude.

We regret to have to refer our readers to a considerable list
of errata whioh we have notieed‚ and we would ask them at onae
to make the alterations there indieated.

These who have in their hands Vol. ΙΙ. will kindly enter in
it a few ooneetions pointed out by Mr. Roby and others, and
indicated byns on the earne page as the list of errata in this

volume.
We add a list of the most importent of the new readings

introdueed now ior the first time into the text, or strongly
oommendod in the notes. With regard to this Table of new
readings we have only to repeat what we said in the Prefaoes
to Vols. Ι. and ΙΙ. It ie a list of eorrections whieh have
not generally been reoeived into the text. Our own oonjeo-
tures must, from the nature oi the ease, preponderate in this
liet, aa they are proposed now ior the first time. Correotions
ol other editors of eourse appear in large numbers in the
text: but as they have already found general aooeptanoe‚ they
do not stand in thie Tabls.

In it we deseribe ourselves as Edd. in the last oolumn. In

the penultimate oolumn the reading aoeepted in the text ie
printed in Roman type, the reading oommended in the notes,
but not given in the text, is printed in italiae. When a MS.

reading is vindieated against a generally reoeivod oonjeeture
the MS. reading is given again in the penultimate oolumn‚
printed in small oape.
