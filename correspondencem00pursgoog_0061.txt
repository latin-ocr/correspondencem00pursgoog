52. MARCUS CAELIUS RUFUS. lvii

but the whole people devoted to your side. How so? Wait for the sequel:
I shall sompel yon to eoaquer against your will. I shall be a seoond Cato'
Yon are all asleep and do not see our weals and exposed points. And itis
notfrom any hope oi reward that I have done this, bnt from what have always
been my most potent motivas, bitterness and sense of wrong (doloris atque
iwds'yns'tatr's caasa). You are waiting for the result oi the battle-wherein
Caesar is perieotly oertain of wiotory Oi oonrse Ι do not know what your -
fornes may be: ours Ι know are praetised in fighting desperately, and in
oheerfully enduring oold and hunger!

The letter, as we have said, shows a mind unhinged by dis·
appointment end buming lor revenge. But what did it all mean?
What was Caelius going to do? Caesar had gone off to Greeoe to
dght Pompeius, and Caelius (the gods having taken away his
reason) thought that now was the timeto play the extreme sooialist:
the people would nise, oreditors and debts would ΒΘ ebolished, the
radioel milleunium would dawn, all the ideals of Oatiline and the
revolutionary party would ΒΘ realised, and Marsus Caelius Rufus
would attain his proper position as hero and saviour of society.†

Meanwhile Trebonius was oanying out Gaesar's sensible laws
about debt. These lawe enaoted that interest paid should ΒΘ

deducted irem the prineipal, aud that oreditois should take the
debtor's property at the saluation it would have had before the

war. Caelius put his ourule ehair beside that of Trebonius, and
promised his magisteriel assistsnoe to any debtor who should refuso
topay. Caesar, in diseussingthisinoident, declares himself ataloss
to eomprehend what sort of mind, what sort of impudente men ean
bave, to keep their properties while aoknowledgiug their debts3 and
the people thought something the same, lor they paid little heed to

Caeliusss So he prooeeded, thoughtlessly and impetuously, to
propose another law, that debts should be paid baolr that day six

years,§ no interest meanwhile being charged-an arrangement

⁸ Caelius appears to mean that Cato was the only one oi the Pompeiane who showed
the least energy. But there was probably no human being in the whole Roman donri·
mans who was fundamentally more opposite in eharaoter to Caelius than was Cato, tha
man of little wit, but at the sams time the man of the most rigid principles, end most
unoompromising wndsteuey.
