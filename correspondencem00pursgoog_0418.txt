306 ADDENDA TO THE ΟΟΜΜΕΝΤΑΒΥ.

1.-111 sciron os irmeneus.
(1111, 1110111.)

Ws heve it ou the authority 11 Macrobius, 11111114, that in the Dc liep- (lisso
maio 1111 rogroa nac nore oo neposne soto of Scipio nmo soson, 1
slsyer oi Tib. Gracchus. Now Q. Caecilius Metellus Scipio, the greci-grundscnsl ¹
Serapion, hed pleced in the Ospitol, necr the Temple oi Ops, a 111111 01 hisgrett l
grendisther, ns he supposed; aud accordingly he drew Atticus' 1111111111 to rhet he
regarded ss an error made by Cicero. But, argues (licere, it wne Metellus Scip‘e 3
himself who made the misteke, ior tha stutue which he bed plsoed in the Oepitel, ,
supposing it to 1111111111 his great-grandfather Serapion, was really a stntseci ³
another person, which he might have known, hed he remembered thet Serapion bed 1
naver been a Concor.

So fet all is plnin; hut it is erident that ior the argument it is 11111111 that Cicero ’
should go 11 leprose that the statue erroneously supposed by Scipio Metellus to bs 111
statue 01 his 11111111, wss really the statue 11 1 mnu 110 bod dees a Censor. Nor,
woording to M, which gives (1111. first and (los. efter, Cicero does indeed gc cu
to stete that the 111111 pleoed in the Capitol hy Scipio Metellus wes the statne 11 ena ἶ
who hed been 1 Censor, ior it bore the inscription (1111.; 111 why does he sny this
statue hed ao cibor inscription but (1111.. and why does he introducent all the mention γ
01 the other statue nesr the Hercules 11 Polycles? The solution 01 the difficultyis, in ᾗ
our mind, this 2-Srns. and (los. should 111111 plocen This trsnspesition wa hers ῗ
accordingly mede 11 111 text. Tha copyist 11 11 saw 1111 the argument required ,
that the statue supposed by Scipio Metellus to be 1111 01111 11111111110111 be 11011 i
to be 111111 ona who bed been s Censor, and so wes in a hurry to inhodnce Osse, not
much troubling himself about the logical annlyds oi the whole 11111111. copyistsde ἕ
not, ss anile, go beyond the first step in any process 01 thought. Now 11 01111 pnt
in the first ploce, and 0111. efter, the wbole argument may be thus pamphrnsad: ,
“Is it possible 1111 Scipio Metellus is 11111111 thst his great-grandfather wnsnercr ζ
Censor? lt is true, indeed, that the 111111 plsoed hy him near the temple 11 Ops, end ,
supposed by him to 11 111 statue 11111 ancestor‚ had 11 inscription 1111111001, l
showing thet ic was the 111111 01 1 person who hed been Consul [This indeed wmld s
not bave shown the statue not to have been the statue 11 Serapion, who was 1111111] 1
But another statue standing nesr the Hercules 11 Polycles bed the inscription 0111ῑ
and it can be proved that it commemoratas the same person as the statne phccdby ἶ
Metellus near the Temple 01 Ops. 'l'hst the two statues cre 1111111 01 the 1111111 ¹
is proved hy the pose, the dress, the ring, in dne, the whole work.'’

Both ere stamas 11 the 11111 men3 therefore, as the stetue neer Polyclas’ 11111111· ,
had the inscription (1111, 110 men commemorated by the two statues must bere bean =
e censor3 but Scipio Nssica Serapion hed neverbeenaGenso13 thmaicre Scipio
Metellus bas mede omistalre about his own great-grundiather, aud the remnrk put by 1
cicero into the mouth 01 Lseliushnsnot been shown tobeincorreot. ³

Both ere, in Cicerc’s opinion, statues 01 Scipio Aiiiccnus Minor, who wss not only l
essu, soc eaor ocu nummio sn sia (sao 11111. rs. 1, oscor esiconem. 5
