lxii INTRODUOTION.

Sulla had revived the old Genucian Law 61 412 (342), which 161

6 long 11166 had not been enforced‚ and which enacted that no one
could be elected to the same magistracy twice except after an
interval often clear years* Caesar, accordingly, could not legally
hold the consulship in any year earlier than 706 (48), and the
electione for that office would be held about J uly 705 (49).

Now the state 61 affairs was this 2-The aristocratia party, the
optimates 66 they 611666 to call themselves, who formed the bulk 61

the 866616, had been all along in opposition to the 1116161116 and
especially 16 Caesar. They never could forgive 61 forget the
contemptuose disregard 61 111616 which he showed during his
consulship, and the revolutionary (as they considered) messuras
which he passed 61 that time. And now he had been passing
from victory to victory, gaining wealth and glory, the hearts of
the soldiers in the camp as he had gained 1116 1166116 61 the people
in the city3 and it was 6111116 more 11116116 the jealous and
indolent nobles that he had at the 6616611166 really done great
and meritorious services to his country. They felt he was growing
quite 166 powerful, and Pompeius was beginning to 1661 the same.
Pompeius too haddone good service to the State in past time,
service if not great at least striking, and he had attained unbounded
popularity 161 it. But he had 161 6 long time been resting on his
1661616 aa the first man in the State, and was altogether too 61111,
awkward, and tactless to make a good statesman: besides his
health was breaking down. Hs wanted rest, but he wanted at
the same 11166 16 be first man in the State3 and he began to see
with ever-increasing 616616666 that his position was becuming 16616
and moro endengered by the uninterruptcd course of victories in
which (166661 was advancing. 8ο insensibly he became alienated
11616 his colleague. The 866616, a collection 61 lirebrands and
ponderans nobodies, wanted a leader-somebody with a great
reputation and a high character ; and the whole bant 61 Pompeius'
nature drew him, especially 61161 his years 61 primaey in the city,
toan 66166 with what was considered the respectable portion of
society. Each party wanted the other, so it was-a mere question
61 accident when the 666111166 would be effected. Nor can there
be any doubt, as has been frequently noticed, that, on 1116 death
