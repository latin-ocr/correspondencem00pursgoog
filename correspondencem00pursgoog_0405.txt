Sodalitates were originally brotherhoods formed tor the maintenance of religione riter
aad for socisd intercourse. ‘Most of the sodalitates were closely connected with the
gens ,· all members ol the gens were sodates, end met together tc keep up the old sowa,
but in historienl times fictitious kinship largely took the place of real kinship, and
ieasting became almost the sole raison d'ttrs of these clube. The parallel oi the London
city Companies will occur to everyone‚' Reid on Cic. Seu. 45. The membcrs were
so iar united that it was customary that they should not sue one another et law, and
they used to give such support es they could to their follow-sodales, end even to the
children ot their follow-sodales. Forming a bond which opinion regarded as so close,
it was only natural that they should use their unity in politice. anh sodalitas worked
together, and thus succesded inintroducinginto public etleira a very considerable organ-
ised body3 and organisation is everything where the governing power is in the hands
of a large body of vetera. The chief features in their organisation of vetera were the
dsmriatto tribuliuml and discriptio populi technioally so·called. There would have
been nothing reprehensible in this, is it was not thot this arrangement and division ot
the vetera were simply ior purposcs cf bribery ; and when the feeling in politice ran
very high, violence naturally enerred irem bodies so organized. The public peace
being thus endengered, a decree ol the Senate was passed in 698 (56 a. (a), ut
sodalitates demriottqus disssdsrmt terque ds is's ferretur sst qui nors discessissent ea
poena quassat ds oi tenerentur, Q. Fr. ii. 3, b, Ep. ccii.

The collegia against which this enactment was directed were strictly guilds of
workmen.² The very wide extent of these clubs, which date from the earliest times,
rney be inierred from the great number of inscriptions which have reference to thern
(Wilmanns’ Index, pp. ael-644). The collegia of worlrmen es well as the redulitatss
had their religione rites, and therewith a very considerable cohesion. Belonging to
the lower strata of the people, we can well understand that they becanu a dengerous
taeter in the city, where there was no proper police, and which was full oi sleves;
and the wonder ie that we do not hear ot legislation directed against them till 686
