11,-11118 JULIA DE REPETUNDIS (oa REPETUNDARUM.)

(an. 1. 18, 8, ar. 881111.)

Tura 1811 vas passed by Caesar in his consulship, 695 (89 a. 8.), aad contained at least
101 clausoe (Cic. Fam. viii. 8, 3, Ep. ccxxiii). Lilo 811 lawe concamiug repetendae,
it had reference to senators only (Rabir. Post, 12 11,). Cicero speaks oi it with great
praise (hoec optimo lec, Sest. 135: cp. Piso, 37) as being a 8818181811, and one carefully
considered (81888 molta aaut seuerius scripta 88881 ia 88818818 legibue et sanetius, Rabir.
Post. 8 ; let acerrimo, Vat. 89; canutum diligenter, Pis. 90).

The sphera 81 the Lex J ulie Repetundarum is given by Marcianus in the Digest
(48, 11, 1, 111.) as referring ed eae pecunias quae quie in magistratu, potestate, curatione,
legatione cel quo clio officio munere ministeriatus publico cepit, cel eum 8888118188 cuiue
eorum est.

Ia some respecta it reproduced the Lex Cornelia majestatis 81 Sulla3 e. 8. in the pro·
vision that the provincial governor should not leave his province, nor euguge inwar on
his ovvn responsibility without the ordor 81 the Senate and people, as Piso thought fit to
do (Pis. 50). In others it rcproduced the Lex Cornelia and the Lex Servilia de repetundis,
e. g. it allowed proccedings against those into whose hands the iraudulently acquired
money had come (persequi ab iis adquae ea pecunie qoam ie ceperit qui 8188188888 811881-
venerit, Rabir. Post, 9) ; in others, again, the Lex Cornelia deprovinciis (cp. Fam. iii
lo, 6, Ep. cclxi), in that it limited the contributione which could be demanded from the
provinciale by the governor aad his rotinus, e. 9. the aunem coronarium could neither
be demanded nor received, except aiter a triumph had been decreed3 orders for travel-
liug at State expense (diplomata) could not be indiscriminately giveu3 the number oi
ships to bc demanded from tho provinciale ior any purpose, and tho amount 81 booty
any commender could 88118 181 himself (op. Fam. ii. 17, 8888811111), was strictly
circumscribed; only a certain quantity 8188111 could be required, aud the speciully
privileged Statcs and individuals 1818 to be really treated as privileged (Piso, 90: cp.
De domo, 88). This latter provisionloads Cicero to call the law iustissima atque optima
(Piso, 37), and it 11811181 Caesar the steady allegiance of the 1188 city of Utica (Bell.
Δ11., 87, 8). 018818 lays great stress on the 1888 thet in his journey through 8118
provinces only ono 81 his legati took from the provinciola anythiog in the shspe 81
entertainment forman or beast, even within the limits 81 the Julian Low Uanum aut
quod leae Jclia dari solet, Ate. v. 16, 3, Ep. ccviii: cp. v. 10, 8, Ep. cxcviii, and v.
81. 5, Ep. col). Yet another provision of the Lex J ulia reproduced 8 law 81 Cicero’s
own, referring to legationes literae, and limitiug 811811 especially os regardo time
(art. xv. ll, 4), most probably to a year (cic. de Leg. iii. 18 : op. Mommsen, St. lt,
ic 818, note 1).

Other provisions appear to 11818 been peculiar to this law; such aa that which

directed that besides the copy 81 his accounts which 8 provincial governor was required
to lodge in the Treasury at Rome (rationes ad 8818νὶ888 referre), 118 should also deposit
(deponere) two other copies in the two most important towns of his province. Cicero
depoeited his accounts at Laodicea aad Apamea (Fam, ii. 17, 8, 4, Ep. colarii. ς att.
vi. 7, 8, Ep. 88111). Again, when a governor was put on his trial 181 extortioa, the
