xlii INTBODUOTION.

in order to quality for the triumph which an optimate was sure
oi obtaining in those bad times. But he got very drunk and
incapable the night before the battle andin consequence was
defeated. The description given by Caelius of Antonius’ state when
the enemy attached is preserved by Quintilian (iv. 2. 123). It is
no doubt highly coloured, indeed perhaps all colour, and not very
agreeable, but it is one of the strongest and most striking picturas
in literature :-

N amque ipsum offendunt temulento sopore profligatum, totis praecordiis
stertentem, ructuosos spiritus geminare, praeclarasque contubernales ab
omnibus spondis transversas incubare et reliquas circumiacere passim: quse
tamen exanimatae terrore, hostium adventu percepto, excitare Antonium

’ conabantur, nomen inclamabant, frustra a cervicibus tollebant, blandius
alia ad aurem invocabat, vehementius etiam nonnulla feriebat: quarum
oum omnium vocem tactumque noscitaret, proximae cuiusque collum am-
plexu petebat: neque dormire excitatus neque vigilare ebrius poterat, sed
semisommo sopore intermunus centurionum concubinarumque iactabatur.

‘There could not be,’ says Quintilian, ‘a more striking represen-
tation, a moro soathing attach, or a more realistis pictura'*
Biting saroasm was the characteristic ol Gaeliuat He was
accordingly pre-eminent as an accuser, his speeohes when aoting
on the defensive being apparently rather tame productione. Quin-
tilian (vi. 3. 69) tells how (licere expressed this by an allegory, when
he said that (laelius had a good right hand but a bad left one, sle.
a good swerd-hand but a bad ahield-hand. Cicero also says oi
Caelius that his pleadings were set off by a brilliant and large yet
at the same time pre-eminently witty and most satirical style of
oratory.‡ No wonder than that he was rechoned as one of the
great oratore of that period, the golden age of Roman oratory,
