xcvi IN TROD U ΟΤΙ ON.

story (cio. Off. iii. 82) that Caesar ever had in his mouth the lines
of Euripides (Phoen. 5245)—

εῗπερ γὰρ ἀδικεῖν χρὴ τυραννίδος πέρι
κάλλιστον ἀδικεῖν, τᾶλλα δ’ εὐσεβεῖν χρεών-

is probably true, and shows that his great intellect did not deceive
itself. But to know that one is doing wrong does not lest-zen,
but rather aggravatos the wrong3 then indeed is iniquity trium·
phant.

To resume. When Caesar, at Ravenna, learned what had
been done at Rome, feeling that promptitude of action was essen-
tial, he at once put his plans in operation. On the l2th or l3th
of J anuary he called together the thirteenth legion, and set before
them the nature of the crisis. He pointed out how his enemies
had wronged him, how they had misled and corrupted the character
of Pompeius3 how jealous the latter had ever been and how gene-
rous he himself3 how the tribunes had been compelled to fly from
the city because they exercised the right of vet0, a right left
untouched even by Sulla3 how the nobles had acted with unpre·
cedented and unjust violence in passing the final decree which
declared the city in danger; and he concluded by an appeal to his
comrades in arms, asking them as their general, who for nine
years had led them from victory to victory till all Gaul and
l] n-rmany were subdued, now that his dignity and reputation were
‘anng assailed, to lend him once more their faithful aid and to
defend him from his enemies. With a cheer the soldiers promised
tm protect from all harm their general and the tribunes of the
penple z* and forthwith the order for march to Ariminum was

given, in the course of which march the proconsul of Gaul would ¹

1³ aas the little stream of the Rubicon, which was the limit of his

authority. That crossed, he had transgressed the laws, and as a ,

ιᾞιτῡΙιιὺιοιιαιὙ leader was bearing arms against his country. The
[lin-vil War had begun.
