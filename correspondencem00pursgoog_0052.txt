the most unexampled and audaoicus profligacy.* Then he puta
forward the ‘ wildoats ' theory, and indeed with as much judgment
and good sense as it can ever be put.† (laelius, we learn, went
to live near her in her brother’s house; many excellent citizens
have been a little wild before they attained to ‘age oonfimed,' while
yet in that dangerous period ol life when it is sc easy to fall3 but
such an orator as Caelius must have been a devoted student of his
art (⁶1 can tell you to become a speaker requires plenty cf work’),
