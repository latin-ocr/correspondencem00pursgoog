ciale to be obliged to give up their employments and rislr their
lives so that (laelius might put himself in the running for the

consulship, on winning which he would again look to the provinno
. to raimburse himself for his expenditure on the Aedilis gemes.

‘Howerer‚’ writes Cicerc,‘ ‘I am doing my best through the shikarees, but
tigers ars very scarae, and, he adds jestingly, ‘those that are to the fore think '
it very hard that they should be the only creaturas under my rule of whom an
urfair advantage has been taken, and have resolved to leave my province and
emigrate into Caria!

But Caelius by no means contented himself with such moderate
demands as these. He had the audacity to ask his friend to
inrpose atax on the province to defray the whole expensos of
his entertainment in Rome. Ol this vectigal odilieicm, Oicerc
had written to his brother Quintum nine years before :-

‘How much eredit yon deservo for delirering your province from that
oppressive and iniquitcus exactior, though it did conse heartbnrnings against
us in high quartersl If one magnate complains openly that your decree has
trien 200,000 sesterces out of his pocket, what would be the sum paid by the
provinces if they were taxed for everyone who gave shows at Rome-and that
was the practice which was rapidly becoming established!

Perhaps it was a recollection cf this letter which dictated the
courteous stemness oi his refusal: ‘Icould not raise this money in
such away, nor, if I were minded to do so, could you accept it.'‡
A similar dignity displays itself in his dismissal of the brutal
Gavius Cicero, it seems, in spite of his practice of refusing the
office of prefect to men engaged in banking business and broking,
had, however, at the request of the noble Brutus, conferred that

appointment on this Gavius, and on one Scaptius, not apparently
the hero oi the Salaminian episode, but probably as great a ruffian,
cicero palliated to himself this concession by the reflection, that
these men did not carry on their business in his own province, but
inOeppadoois. However he had reason to regret his complaisance.

‘One Gavius,’ ho writes tc Atticur,§ ‘to whom I gire a profectura at the
request cf Brutus, is habitually disrespectfnl tc me in his words and demeanonr.
A sort of spaniel of Clodius he is. He did not attend me when Ι left Apamea ;
